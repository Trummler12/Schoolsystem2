The resulting wave is similar to the initial wave but phase-shifted. The magnitude of the shift depends on the amplitude of a second-order wave produced by the charged particles’ oscillations. These oscillations, modeled as simple harmonic motion, are driven by the light's electric field. The amplitude of the oscillations depends on the difference between the light’s angular frequency and the material’s resonant angular frequency.",2023-11-30T18:42:33Z,2023-11-30T18:42:33Z,1
