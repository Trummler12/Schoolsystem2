iEAp_6Jo5O4,11:38,en,true,true,ok,,so in the video yesterday we talked about how many satellites there were in orbit around our planet and you may have learned about how much stuff they're actually already is but I didn't really discuss is how much chunk there is as well now that's a completely different story because in comparison to the actual number of satellites the amount of so-called space debris or I guess in some say sense space junk is absolutely mind-blowing according to recent observations by NASA there are close to about thirty thousand pieces that are about a few inches or about ten centimeters in size and even more so smaller pieces as a matter of fact the estimates for tiny pieces less than one centimeter are close to about 150 million that is a lot of stuff orbiting around the planet and of course it creates a lot of dangerous for the actually active spacecraft and satellites that are currently there including the International Space Station and today I actually wanted to discuss what happened back in 2009 when it finally happened two satellites actually collided with one another at a really really high speed of eleven thousand seven hundred meters per second creating quite a huge explosion and lots of lots of debris now this particular satellite or I guess these two satellites were from two different countries and ironically one was from the US and one was from Russia now the American satellite is actually part of the Iridium Network and you can actually track every debris from that collision right here in stuff in space and there you go this is the currents we actively track debris from this particular collision and as you can see there is a lot of stuff out there when it just happened the actual number was close to about two thousand in the last year some of the debris actually returned to the planet so now it's just under 1000 but there are still a lot of Reuel little pieces that were not really tracking anymore or can track because they're so tiny when I say little I mean like this babe and a piece this big traveling at anywhere from eight to nine kilometers per second can actually pretty much destroy any spacecraft like literally almost instantly so let's talk a little bit more about what actually happened this is the iridium network it's the most popular most active telecommunications network in the US and one of these satellites iridium 33 collided with the no longer active Russian military satellite and as you can see both of them were travelling really fast and it was a direct collision almost director said about 90 degree collision and the amount of debris that was generated because of this this actual angle was ridiculous and as a matter of fact it endangered quite a lot of other satellites luckily nothing really happened and at some point back in 2012 it even endangered the international space station because of one pieces that came relatively close now iridium network is still pretty active there's a still 66 satellites that are used regularly and this particular satellite was also still working however the Russian satellite that you see right there was inactive for about 12 years it was a military satellite had only worked for two years and I was then disabled and became a space debris for 12 years nobody really knew where it was but the approximate location was known prior to the actual collision the original network actually did receive a warning but it said that the actual passage of two satellites would be about 500 metres apart which actually brings up a really excellent point the amount of satellites out there and the actual precision in tracking them is still much much lower and and not as precise as it really should be according to the Iridium network executives the amount of actual warnings they get per week is close to about 400 in other words every satellite that they have of their 66 satellites is in danger of colliding pretty much every week and when I say in danger it means that they pass other objects or other satellites within about 5 kilometers in other words the precision of tracking the objects and the amount of objects out there means that at this point it's sort of a lottery we're not really sure if one of the collisions might happen again and we weren't even sure that this was going to happen I mean it was actually supposed to be much farther away than it really was and just to give you a bit of a perspective on how much energy was generated here well this is an approximate amount but if you were to convert this to basically TNT exploding here is what hundred tons of TNT looks like this is during the Trinity test and here's an actual explosion of the that hundred tons this is of course when the US was developing the nuclear weapons in other words this right here produces this much of an explosion via collision between these two satellites produced about one-fifth of that so that's a lot of energy that's basically like 20 tons of TNT exploding right there in space and producing a tremendous amount of debris and when it comes to the actual reasons for this happening and I guess essentially how to avoid this in the future the biggest problem here was that well first of all Russia was not really communicating with other nations on the exact locations of the military satellites and of course that's kind of obvious because they're military satellites but at the same time us regularly tracks them actually a very precise way but in this specific case the actual tracking was no longer as accurate because the satellite was not really functioning anymore so there was no real priority of tracking the satellite but the debris itself is still technically as dangerous as a satellite itself but we of course have actually been predicting this happening for a very very long time as a matter of fact the idea that is actually known as Kessler syndrome is that when one collision occurs it produces a lot of debris that is then sort of expansion growth as each of these pieces collides with another satellite and this is the premise for gravity and the main storyline here starts with essentially satellites colliding and destroying International Space Station and put in Sandra Bullock in this relatively uncomfortable situation however unfortunately even though this particular collision occurred there haven't really been many advances in terms of actual regulations and laws to prevent this from happening in the future one major regulation is that many satellites are now required to actually try to position themselves in the so called graveyard orbit that's right above the geostationary orbit right here it's the orbit right above it however not all saris are capable of doing this and also pretty much none of the major nations are enforced to do so I believe only France actually made the law or made a regulation for all of the future launches to actually have some kind of a provision for satellite to dispose of itself but France doesn't want that many satellites and so it's not really going to save us from future collisions and if you watch the video yesterday I also talked about how in the last 10 or so years we've actually launched about 25% of all of the satellites ever and the actual number of satellites is increasing every single year and we're becoming really good at it and only some satellites are designed to return back to the atmosphere and basically dispose of themselves the majority of satellites that are launched don't have those provisions just yet at least they're not required to by law because there is really no law just yet and so to avoid collisions like this that generate a tremendous amount of debris like you see right here we do need to have these laws we need to have these regulations and the space industry needs to actually come up with international laws that enforce this we need to enforce debris from being a problem now there was another event that actually generated quite a lot of debris as well this was a weapon testing by China back in 2007 when they actually decided to destroy one of their own satellites using military-grade rockets and that also generated a lot of debris so this was kind of also not a good thing to do because now a lot of satellites at this particular altitude of about 850 kilometers are also in danger of getting hit by a pieces of something so that's actually the amount of debris the race between the altitudes of 600 and thousand kilometers and for the most part we actually have more chance of colliding with debris now than we do with micro meteorites as a matter of fact there's almost no danger of having micro meteorites here but there's a lot of danger of being hit by a piece of leftover from a satellite and specifically the biggest amount of stuff out there right now is not even satellite pieces it's actually like paint from satellites and also leftover pieces or specifically frozen pieces of rocket fuel or rocket coolants and a lot of them generate ice flakes or basically ice pieces that could be as big as this and travel really close as fast as well and collide with other things in space so considering that the space launches are going to only increase the number we definitely need to all come together and basically come up with some sort of a regulation that everybody has to abide by because as the number of launches increases as we get more and more entrepreneurs or private companies like SpaceX launching things pretty much regularly we actually need to have an international regulation that will prevent anything like in the movie gravity from happening Kessler syndrome or Casper effect that I actually discussed in one of the videos you can find above I believe it was actually one of the first videos I made on a channel when I started actively producing space videos but anyway so this particular phenomenon is going to become a huge problem as the number of satellites increases and so in order for us to avoid another Iridium cosmos collision that you see right here that generate a tremendous amount of energy we definitely need to have not as binding agreements but also better tracking systems and most importantly possibly even companies or organizations regularly tracking the debris regularly finding ways to remove debris from space and basically making sure that everybody agrees to these regulations if one of these satellites collides again it's very likely that the actual Kessler syndrome will become a reality and we might end up with something like in the movie gravity and so if one day your smartphone stops working and you don't really get any reception on TV you know that something probably went wrong up there in space and it's very likely that a lot of things are going to shut down pretty much instantly anyway thank you for watching I hope you learned something from this video now you know a little bit more about this

sjX2AzR-z7o,10:42,en,true,true,ok,,"Hello YouTube and welcome to my channel. In today's video, we're going to be making an account at auction, the Korean eBay equivalent. In the previous video, we we actually tried to make an account on Garket and hopefully succeeded. But this is this time is going to be auctioned and it's a little bit more challenging. This will actually give you an idea of how to make accounts on various other sites because this is a very typical Korean uh account creation service. So, uh this is what the homepage looks like right now. There's some kind of a sale going on with hedgehogs and more hedgehogs and lions. And basically what you want to do is you want to look for well first of all you want to use Internet Explorer. Nothing else will work. Uh so do use Internet Explorer on Windows. Um go to the top of the page and right here it's kind of hard to see but right here it says login. If you can't read Korean, I'm going to show you a little trick in a second. But before I show you the trick, try to find this button. There's really only three letters. it says log in uh or basically click on everything until you see something that looks like this. This is a login screen. Now here we're looking at um creating a new account. I don't actually have an account yet. So so I'm actually going to be making this from scratch as well and we'll see if it works or not. So this gray button right here, gray button on the left is basically make an account. You will then get this kind of a screen that basically gives you more choices here. And this is actually a little bit more confusing. Uh there's choices here and there's choices here. These are the ones you're looking at. Um the red ones. In other words, this is for uh people under 14 years old. Uh or foreigners. That's us. Yay. Or here you have adults in Korean adults. You can actually click on this and it's pretty much the same thing. But I'm going to click on this because it's a little bit easier. And you don't have to if you actually click on this, you'll see that there's a lot of agreements you have to sign. And basically that's I don't want to be responsible for this because I do not understand what those agreements are. Um click on the one with the kids and all that. Basically the top red button. And here there's several choices. You can register using your um hand cell phone. Uh or you can use a foreign registration number. If you click on this it will give you various choices here. Um I actually haven't done it this way because I always always use my cell phone. Your cell phone is also connected to your alien um identity or what is it called? ARC alien registration card also known as foreign registration number. So you can use either one. I believe it's actually the same thing. Uh so let's actually look at what you need to enter here. So there's a this will be entered automatically for you. All of this will be entered once you actually click on this button which will bring up which will bring up this window right here. It will actually ask you to install various things and software and security thingyamajigs. So do install them because that's how it works in Korea. There's four choices you have. Um I don't So yes, you need to know your cell phone provider and you need to have an actual cell phone for for you to be able to use this. And it has to be a Korean cell phone with uh with your name or someone's name that you you know and can type. Uh so I don't really know what you have, but I have this. So, you will get a window that kind of looks like this, possibly a little bit different. Here's what you have to enter. And this is actually very very typical uh Korean registration through cell phone window. So, make sure that you know how to use this. This one right here is for way books, which is basically foreigners, that's us. Um this here has to be your name and specifically how you actually wrote it on your cell phone um registration form when you were registering for for a cell phone. So this is your name exactly letter to letter or a Korean name if someone registered for you if you're using Korean friend to register. Uh then male or female left is male right is female. This right here it's either you are a Korean or a foreigner. So choose this this the bottom part. Then your birthday and then your phone number. So enter your phone number here. And basically after this, make sure that you click on all of these buttons because that's basically more agreements, more stuff to agree to. And finally, after you enter your phone number, click on this. So, I'm going to do this in a second because I don't want you to know my phone number. And then you will see a window that kind of looks like this. If you did everything correctly, pick up your phone because you're going to be getting a message. And I have two minutes. Oh, no. Stress. So much stress. Uh, and two minutes and 40 seconds to enter this number. All right. So these are all randomly generated and they will be coming to you from some kind of a government secret society of numbers and basically enter the number and click on yes the blue left button. If you did everything correctly all your information will be now appearing in all of the boxes below. So anyway so all of your info will be entered here. I'm not showing it to you because it's private but this is really it. And then what you do afterwards and then what you do afterwards is so you have your name on top then you have right underneath it this is where you enter your login your desired login it's not letting me choose this because this is not available then here this is your password it will actually not u make the little star theme so unfortunately you'll have to actually expose your password then you go down scroll down and right under your phone number there's a part here that says enter your email. So, this is where you enter your email and choose either one of these or select one and just type it in. Uh, so this is basically where you type in uh whatever your service is, email.com. Now, these two things I would not actually check because I made that mistake before. This is event SMS thingies that basically will spam your phone with various specials and coupons and such. and you probably won't get or understand what they're saying because it's all going to be in Korean and you'll get them every day. So, uncheck this if it's checked by accident. The rest you should check because all of these are agreements and all kinds of um you know, service agreements that you need to be able to to be aware of. Unfortunately, since you don't read Korean, probably just like uh I I don't or I don't understand enough Korean, you probably won't be able to get what any of this says. But anyway, we have to check all of this. Now, instead of clicking on each of these individually, you can just click on this top one and they'll all be selected automatically. Now, here's the thing. If you actually want to read them, if you want to know what they say or if you want to translate some of these words, for example, this one and this one you can't really copy paste into Google Translate because it's not a word, it's actually a picture. A lot of Korean websites have a tendency to put pictures instead of actual words. If you want to translate this, you can still translate this. And there's an awesome awesome feature that you may have on your phone and not know about. And that awesome feature is obviously Google Translate, but the phone edition. If you open the phone edition of your Google Translate, unfortunately, I can't really show it to you because it doesn't really uh well, okay, here is what it looks like. It's going to look kind of like this. Now, this is the app for Google Translate. On on the right side, there's a photo picture. Click on it and it will actually have um whatchamacall it um a scanner thing. Align the scanner with your screen. I'm going to do this right now actually just to see if it works well because I have not used this in a while and it might not work well anymore. But basically, as you line up with the screen, it's going to scan the words and ask you to select which words you want to translate. I'm going to do this right now. And and there you go. It just translated this for me. Number three, it says terms and condition agreement, which is exactly what this is. It makes sense, too, right? Because it looks like that. Um, so yeah, that's a feature that you may want to use with this website because if you want if you want to translate something on auction and it is in Korean, just scan it with your phone, rub it with your finger, and it will open uh or I guess it will translate the words that you select with your finger. Anyway, so let's move on and finish registration. Oh, and by the way, don't forget to check this thingy because it will actually ask you to check it. I just realized I made this mistake and I did not click on this. So, this has to be clicked on. And that's it. So, at the end, it will tell you uh your login name. Yes, you did it. Congratulations. And we can actually even translate this. Let's use our Google Translate to see what it actually says. And what it says in broken English is that I have completed auction. No, it says nice to have the auction has been completed. Individual purchase signup. So you can probably figure out that it basically means that you signed up for the account successfully. Congratulations, you can now log in and use auction uh for purchasing various items. So just to test this, let's actually go ahead and type something like shoes and then select a random shoe and see if we can actually use it. So just like in the previous video, you'll basically be be using very similar features here. You'll have to uh Oh, boy. Something's happening. No, no, don't give me all of the shoes. Just give me one shoe. Oh, no. I I think I clicked on something wrong because there's a lot of pictures that are loading here. Oh my god, they're actually selling me some really crazy shoes here. Anyway, so yeah, this is what I was looking for here. Uh obviously you can Google translate this as well, but basically you select the number of shoes, the size you want and then this here is the purchase button and then you follow the same instructions as you uh as you did in the previous video. And essentially this is how you register for these services in Korea. As long as you have a cell phone that's under your name using your registration card or if someone does it for you, your own registration card, uh you can pretty much register anywhere online. So that box of you saw before with the little cell phone thingy that you had to then confirm using the message that you got from your cell phone, that's how you register for everything in Korea. Any kind of a website will always kind of they will always require you to do this because in Korea really there is no anonymity on the internet. You're always always uh leaving a trail behind. So anyway, basically that's how you register and this is how you do it. So now I can basically loging in using my ID that I've created and my password that you will never never know. And once you log in, yes, there we go. A new account. So then I can just basically purchase anything. So thank you for watching and leave a comment if you want to see more videos about Korea and how to make things happen for a foreigner. Bye-bye and enjoy auction shopping. Hopefully this works for you as well and see you later."
IwvZavzQPgc,2:46:33,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person this is Anton and well let's talk about that picture of Sagittarius A star the black hole in the middle of our own Galaxy the picture that was actually only revealed yesterday from when I'm making this video and so in this video I guess first of many videos that we'll be making about the discovery I really wanted to talk about some of the details that were revealed during the presentation if you haven't watched it and also talk a little bit more about some of the more common questions with potential answers about what we've just observed essentially trying to figure out exactly what we're looking at right here this is the image and exactly what some of these features are including the unusual dots the three bright dots you see on the picture and so let's discuss the black hole itself and of course the image of the black hole but think of this as part 1 of our investigation because there are so many things to discover which I guess is a good way for me to remind you to subscribe if you still haven't let's begin so first of all all of the info all of the studies and everything as always is in the description below so if you'd like to check this out by yourself you can find everything there but what I wanted to start this is with the name itself because during my stream like yesterday one of the more common questions was why is it called studio is a star well first of all what you look at right here is known as Sagittarius A it's a very unusual Active Radio source region in the center of our own Galaxy that as you can see from this radio image has a lot of activity pretty much everywhere if you look closer there are some regions called Sagittarius C there are certain regions called Sagittarius B and that's because everything here is in constellation of Sagittarius the constellation you see right there in the video from the eso but if you were to look around the radio region of Sagittarius A you would actually discover an extremely bright point a point that seems to represent a gradational center of this particular region this point is known as Sagittarius A asterisk or Sagittarius A star with the star itself just being the way that we pronounce that asterisk although in this region you can also find some other activities in for example a very ancient Supernova Remnant in Sagittarius A East and the very unusual spiral structure in Sagittarius A West but it's of course an unusual bright and variable spot in the middle Sagittarius A star that's always been of the most interest and over several decades of observation in different frequencies including the x-rays the scientists were able to determine that this is most likely where our Central black hole is located with this iconic animation produced by the scientists from ESO differentially illustrating that a lot of stars in the region definitely seem to orbit something unusual in the middle something that possesses a matter of over 4 million masses of the sun with further Evidence coming from many different so-called s stars for example the most famous one being S2 we've discussed this one somewhere on the channel should be in the description below whose orbits even indicated that there are aloro einsteinian effects including Doppler effects happening when they approach this unusual Center that seems to be some kind of a massive supermassive object and although there have been suggestions that maybe it's some kind of unusual Dark Matter chunk maybe some sort of a exotic matter that we've never seen before possibly even exotic matter that was predicted by various ideas and theories some of the recent papers definitively established that whatever it is it seems to be in an extremely small region of space and so by definition this could only be a black hole because nothing else can be so dense and one with a mass of approximately 4.2 to maybe 4.3 million masses of the sun all this was established by observing those S stars and a lot of other objects orbited in this region for many many years actually over two decades now but then a decade ago back in 2009 several scientists kind of disappeared to create something unusual they proposed an earth-sized telescope in order to possibly observe some of these black holes or maybe even create an image of one the idea sounds a little bit Preposterous at first but as more and more radio telescopes became operational around the planet it actually sort of became a reality this idea became known as The Event Horizon telescope because their main purpose because game taking a picture of the black hole and so since roughly around 2017 by using eight different observatories on the planet they started to essentially collect a lot of radio data from several regions in the universe specifically focusing on two black holes m87 and Sagittarius A star here's by the way what the size of the aperture of this telescope in theory looks like so it's an earth-sized telescope but there is a small side note I'd like to make that I also mentioned on the stream since there are only 8 observators involved here it's as if you had only 8 pixels in your camera so imagine having a smartphone camera where only 8 of your pixels work now in order to take a picture of that camera you're going to have to take a look at something for an extremely long time and very likely come up with some kind of an algorithm in order to work out what each of those pixels saw and how all this connects into a bigger picture that's literally what they had to do for many years since 2017 all these observations then had to be combined using VA very complex algorithm and also using thousands of terabytes of data collected from several observatories on the planet with the most difficult location to reach and also get data from being the one in Antarctica you're about to see the observatory right there and so creating this image literally involved a bunch of different points from different telescopes trying to sort of create a full picture at the end and in this case the picture would actually look entirely different if certain telescopes were absent so on the more telescopes the higher resolution we get and also in order to create an algorithm that would work with all these observations the scientists had to run computer simulations using supercomputers in order to determine what they're most likely to see in this region so essentially this was a combination of computer simulations with physical observations from these eight radio telescopes and there's obviously a reason why they chose these two black holes and nothing else not Andromeda galaxy for example which has been mentioned on my stream both of these black holes if you were to look at them in a nice case would represent the largest possible objects although the largest here is a bit of a misnomer here they actually compare the size of this to essentially seeing a donut on the surface of the Moon that's how tiny these black holes are in our night skies but still these are the largest black holes we see in the night skies so this would be the easiest to potentially image at the moment we don't actually have technology for anything else and here's the donut but there's a reason why Sagittarius A star was not shown to us back in 2019 but instead they chose to present us with m87 even though m87 looks slightly smaller in the night skies as you're about to see here it's actually significantly bigger if you were to basically place it much closer to us it would be a gigantic object here's what it's going to look like very very close to um Sagittarius A star so here's another way of visualizing this if you were to look at the m87 picture you'd notice that you can fit the orbit of Pluto into the black hole's Shadow with the Voyager 1 probe being at the edge of the Shadow but inside of this a tiny pixel would literally represent the size of our black hole and even the size of its accretion disk with Mercury's orbit representing the approximate size of the entire image we saw and so the difference here is actually quite dramatic the black coincide amazing 7 is approximately 1500 times more massive than the one in the Milky Way but it also happens to be approximately 2 000 times as far away from us so because of this their size in the night skies is relatively similar but the advantage of taking a picture of m87 is really in regards to how fast things move here if you were to look at them from a distance so first of all m87's black hole or m87 star or poeh hits It's also known happens to be an active black hole so there's a lot of activity here there's also a lot of sort of churning and turning but the material here because of the size of the accretion disk moves much much much slower as a matter of fact and you can actually look at the same spot for a pretty long time and collect a lot of data from that spot specifically gas can actually take anywhere from days to even weeks to orbit around this black hole but around our own black hole because Sagittarius A star is not an active black hole and also because the accusation disk here is much much slower things here move very very fast it could actually take anywhere from a few minutes to possibly a few hours for some of the particles to move around and that means that collecting data here is way more challenging you basically are looking at something that's moving so fast that any kind of an exposure photography is going to be practically impossible one of the best images I found recently to illustrate this is actually this if you haven't seen this before take a guess at what you're actually looking at well you might be able to guess simply based on the observations of the environment near these unusual lights this is a train it's a fast moving train the picture which was taken during night time using long exposure and in essence this is kind of similar to what you're seeing here except that these images were produced slightly differently in this case the pictures of these two black holes were produced using two techniques clustering and averaging this video right here kind of explains how this works so first of all you take a bunch of creations and you try to Cluster them into different most common images class cluster 1 cluster 2 3 4 5 and so on then by taking each individual most common cluster we try to average everything out creating the most likely representation of what this black hole might look like so in essence this kind of explains some of the features we're seeing here these three unusually bright dots for example were simply created because these were the most common elements appearing in most of the pictures if you look closer here you can actually see that for example in the first cluster there were only two of these bright dots in a second cluster there was this very bright dot right here which obviously appeared in at least a dozen of different images and then we had these other spots in the other locations as well and so by averaging all of these images they've created this European Southern Observatory also created a kind of a more easier to understand simulation to help us understand how this works in this case using this mountainous formation to show us how they did this so here we're taking a bunch of images of the mountains and we're taking them during different times of the day and during different types of weather then by taking all these images and clustering them together we're going to find most common elements then by averaging these clusters we're going to be creating something that looks like this like the image on the right and so this image shows us what the average representation of this structure is when the sky is behind it sort of representing a blur of different weather effects even though individual frames might actually look entirely different depending on the time of the day and so we're not seeing the exact image of the black hole but we are seeing a kind of averaged out version of everything that happened here during the period of the observation which lasted for a few months and also a super important addition here is that this is not an optical image the orange and yellow here represents radial light so in essence we're not actually seeing this what we are seeing are various radio emissions coming from various parts of the accretion disk due to the interaction of matter plasma and most likely magnetic field that create a super super hectic environment with a lot of radio waves coming our way so in that sense this is more of a scientific symbolic representation of the black hole as a also an actual image in reality if we were to potentially be there and look at this with our own eyes and pass away some other sensors using for example X-rays and gamma-ray detectors we would probably see an extremely powerful fast spinning Taurus of dust and a lot of material where things move very fast things flicker a lot there are a lot of explosions a lot of different emissions or maybe even something resembling what you see in this video with a large dark object in the middle producing certain dilation effects and also certain Doppler shifts and other effects predicted by Einstein and since all of this stuff is essentially plasma it would to some extent resemble our sun and also one of the more common questions during the stream was in regards to maybe using other telescopes like the iconic James Webb Telescope to maybe take a better picture of this so we can actually see what it looks like in for example infrared and Optical light well once again that would probably not be possible because this right here is already a much bigger telescope the size of the mirror on jeans swap is very very tiny in comparison but even if we were to capture an image from here we would most likely see almost nothing for one simple reason the galactic center is very very thick and most of the Dust here pretty much makes the observations in Optical light or even in infrared light quite impossible but even if we could see the black hole in Optical or infrared light because of the distances involved nearly 26 000 light years away from us we would still not really be seeing much and here we would still be dealing with the same problem of things moving way way too fast around the black hole because of the dramatic changes in brightness and a lot of other changes including the changes in the shape of the accretion disk even without dust covering everything James Webb would still not be able to produce a very good picture as a matter of fact the only way for us to take a better picture of all of this specifically using radio light is to add more observatories around the planet or potentially launch observatories into space which can create an even bigger aperture for this particular telescope and this is something that has been planned by the EHT team but at the moment there's no future plans for any of this and also generally this would be pretty expensive any kind of a Space Telescope usually requires huge amounts of funds and so that averaging and clustering technique is really at the moment the only way to make these images and to make any observations possible but this is just obviously the first such step as a matter of fact now that we know that the region around our own black hole doesn't seem to be as active as some of the other black holes it might actually be possible to take even better images in the future or even help the scientists see the Event Horizon and the shadow of the black hole styling it in a lot more detail and one of the more surprising discoveries coming out of this image is really in regards to how all of this seems to fit well with Einstein's theory of general relativity specifically the size of the ring and even the size of the Shadow fits almost perfectly into every prediction scientists have been making for many years and this applies to both m87 and Sagittarius A star which of course confirms that many theories in regards to black holes for the most part seem to be correct which also means we can start making other predictions but just the fact that despite size differences these two black holes seem to appear quite similar to one another already means that by observing one black hole we can start making a lot of assumptions and inferences about other black holes as well including some that are really really small and so even though these two black holes are located in two completely different galaxies and seem to be generally quite different from one another they seem to be still very very similar especially at their edge with most likely any differences that we see just being because of certain types of material that's present on the outskirts for example maybe more dust more different types of stars or some kind of a supernova Remnant which could have added material that would not be there otherwise but these differences can actually help us figure out how these black holes interact or even shape the environment around themselves in other words by looking at these my new differences between different black holes we might be able to finally start figuring out how a typical black hole might actually affect the rest of the Galaxy although four are one black hole Sagittarius estar it's still a bit of a challenge to see things and to actually analyze things mostly because the orbital period extremely close to the black hole is only approximately half an hour but to get really accurate data from planet Earth we want to observe something for at least 12 hours so unfortunately there's just no way to try to resolve this just yet with the the world of this very turbulent and extremely powerful plasma basically blocking a lot of the other observations in other types of wavelengths but despite all these successes from The Event Horizon telescope and despite the fact that there are now two images of black holes there are still so many unanswered questions even simple questions such as for example how far away is this like for example during the stream the distance was mentioned as 27 000 light years away from us but the most accurate observations from Japan from only a couple of years ago suggested that the black hole is approximately 25 700 light years away from us so even the distance to the black hole is still currently known then we have more questions in regards to astrophysical Jets how exactly are these formed today is believed that a lot of magnetic interaction happens around the black hole that causes this to happen but it's still a bit unclear also in this image what exactly happened around the spot here how is it that so many different images from the black hole seem to have a much brighter spot on the farce side of the black hole one explanation could be because of the flares in The Far Side of the accretion disk which could then be seen because of the abandon of light From The Far Side but at the moment it's not really clear but I guess the biggest question out of all of this is what exactly is the orientation of the black hole tour less during the eso stream some of the scientists suggested that it could be actually sort of almost facing us as in instead of being sideways with the accusing disc possibly shown as the edge we could be looking at this from maybe this Angle now that currently does not make sense and as I mentioned in the Stream the reason it would make sense is because of the discoveries from just under a year ago where the scientists identified actual remnants of ancient astrophysical jets that might have been created only a few thousand years ago and they were appointed more or less perpendicularly from us so something here doesn't add up or maybe the black hole has some kind of a precession slash some kind of a wobble where it does sort of move around this way now that's of course a huge assumption and right now there's really no proof of any of this but this is sort of where I reached the level of my ignorance in regards to this image right here and I'm definitely going to have to follow up on this because I would love to find out what exactly the scientists discovered in regards to the orientation of the black hole at the moment it's super unclear and seems to be the biggest mystery how wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing this relatively recent discovery about this somewhat exciting region that we're sort of in the middle of known as the local bubble the region that you kind of see simulated right here and something really exciting has been recently discovered about this region helping the scientists understand and to some extent map a lot of the nearby star formation regions and also helping us understand how most galaxies including of course the Milky Way most likely evolve and create new stars but I guess more importantly really helping us understand a little bit more about our own neighborhood and our place in it but first of all let's start with this beautiful map created a few months ago the map I showcased in one of the older videos that basically shows us what the local neighborhood sort of looks like with all of the nearby stars with the sun right here in the middle but also sort of demonstrating a lot of different cloud formations around the Sun itself with the this distance right here being approximately 65 light years across and if you look at this map you'll see that our sun seems to be sort of in the middle of two different clouds the local Interstellar cloud and the so-called g-cloud and a lot of modern studies are actually trying to understand what affects the clouds that we're sort of passing through has on for example planet Earth on a lot of different types of radiation reaching the solar system and more importantly if it actually has any effect on the climate of course mostly because some previous Studies have even suggested that by passing through these clouds it sort of increases the amount of interplanetary dust which can then maybe block the sunlight now none of this has been definitively proven and most of this is still kind of just assumptions and ideas that are kind of difficult to prove but it still will be interesting to find out if passing through these clouds has really any effect on anything in the solar system the more important Point here is that well there are quite a whole these clouds and most of them were most likely created by ancient Supernova but if we were to zoom out of here quite dramatically we would also find ourselves in the so-called local bubble sometimes also referred to as the local cavity and this unusual cavity or this local bubble in essence is a kind of a void that's approximately 1 000 light years across with quite an unusual shape not really spherical where the actual density of hydrogen and specifically neutral hydrogen is approximately 10 times lower than it is everywhere else in the Galaxy or in other words it's basically a low density area in other words it's a kind of a structure that seems to be extremely low in density and has way way less hydrogen than a lot of other areas in the Milky Way and to be more exact or to be more mathematical in the local Interstellar Cloud the density of hydrogen is approximately 0.3 atoms per centimeter Cube or to give you a more visual analogy a single volume equivalent to a typical sugar cube would contain 0.3 hydrogen atoms but if you were to leave the cloud and if you were to then reach the so-called local bubble the density drops by about 10 times it becomes about 0.05 atoms per a single sugar cube and so the question here was well first of all what exactly created this local bubble or this low density cavity and more importantly does it have any effect on the nearby space and for the longest time one of the main culprits for the creation of the local bubble was the very very famous Pulsar that exploded as a supernova the poles are known as jiminga one of the brightest posters in the night skies but this was an assumption from years ago and since then the scientists realized that the local bubble is just way too big to be produced by a single Supernova and this is one of the first things that this recent study was able to kind of clarify the study here explained that at least several different Supernova over a period of about 14 million years had to occur in order to create the local bubble that we have today so it wasn't just one single poster it actually probably created several posters and possibly even several black holes interestingly the study also clarified that the Sun and planet Earth were not around back then and it just so happens that we enter this region completely by accident now in other words the fact that we are right at the center of this local bubble is sort of a complete accident the solar system is flying through this region and is going to leave this region in the next few millions of years but because there were 15 different Supernova happening here at least one of them might have affected planet Earth to some extent as well although that's not really the main point here the main point is that while this bubble is still quite Dynamic and it's still growing with the material moving away from the center at approximately 6 kilometers per second but what's even more exciting about the discovery from this paper is the fact that the scientists ident to fight several star-forming regions and so here we're talking about regions where usually you have very active star formation all of which seem to be right at the edge of the bubble all which is slightly easier to see in the map that you can find in the description below in other words what this study suggests is that this bubble and the creation of this bubble might be directly responsible for pretty much most of the startup formation in all of the nearby young star-forming regions and that of course includes pretty much most of the molecular clouds that scientists usually use to study these star formations as a matter of fact this study even goes as far as implying that within about 500 light years away from planet Earth and the Sun that you see right there all of these star-forming regions and all of the young planets in young Stars literally sit on the surface of this giant bubble with the bubble itself most likely being directly responsible for initiating their formation possibly by forming some kind of a pressure wave as as all of the cavity expands and creates the actual conditions needed to start star-forming regions with all of this driven by the pressure creating from a lot of these Supernova in the past and specifically these Seven Star forming regions that have been studied in the past by many different studies all seem to be right at the surface of the bubble and that's actually a pretty big Discovery this implication suggests to us that maybe this is actually how all of the Star formation starts in various galaxies out there as well basically by having these really large cavities that are created by various Supernova the surface of these cavities the surface of these bubbles might create all the necessary conditions for new stars to start forming and thus create new generation and new population of stars that will then lead to new Supernova that will then produce even more stars furthermore just the fact that we seem to be right in the center of such a Super Bubble is basically a statistical anomaly it just means that there is a really really high chance these super bubbles are extremely common mostly because we found ourselves right in the middle of one it's very unlikely that there's just one such bubble in the entire galaxy or because statistically we would not be right in the center of one if these structures were not common and that of course implies that the Milky Way galaxy is probably made up of all of these super bubbles all over the place with many of them doing exactly the same thing creating these cavities and creating the surface of cavities where new stars form to some extent the scientists in this paper even compare this to Swiss cheese with every hole in the Galaxy or every hole in a cheese created by these really large Supernova that happen over time with each individual surface of each individual bubble serving as the new formation region for new stars and new planets furthermore because all of these star forming regions seem to be moving away from the center of the bubble with the actual velocity vectors pointing away from the center all of these discoveries from this paper further suggest that this seems to be indeed the process that leads to the formation of a vast majority of stars in the galaxy possibly not all stars but many stars with this 3D map right here being the most accurate representation of the nearby space but naturally there are still quite a lot of questions for example we obviously don't know how many of these bubbles or super bubbles we would find in a galaxy like the Milky Way because technically these are voids and they contain less material on the inside they will be very very difficult to detect since it's a lot easier to find something rather than find nothing the scientists also don't really know if these bubbles end up touching at some point and what happens if they do touch do they actually interact with one another in some way and if they do interact what exactly happens when the do end up colliding but I guess the bigger question here is well how exactly do these super bubbles and their expansion Drive the formation of new stars what processes play a role here in order to begin the star-forming regions that we've observed so many times in different studies they obviously produce some kind of a pressure wave because of these ancient Supernova but what's the actual process by which the pressure wave then forces the material to start coalescing into Stars so definitely a lot of questions to answer even though this is a pretty exciting Discovery helping us understand a little bit more about our own Galaxy and today we're going to be discussing yet another mystery slash observation coming from the center of our galaxy The Milky Way and this time it's a mystery that's been sort of I guess mysterious for quite a long time now for actually close to about four decades the mystery of these unusual filamental structures found pretty much all across the Galaxy that we live in but also in other galaxies as well with the new updates in regards to this creating this absolutely mind-blowing image that you see right here that essentially demonstrates how many of these filaments are in our galaxy with a new study and some of the new images reviewing nearly 1 000 of these unusual Sprints but some of them as long as hundreds to 150 light years in length stretching pretty much all over the Galaxy but mostly in the center but many of them also possessing some really unusual features many of them being multi-layered or positioned in an extremely orderly manner with some of them also being part of some other unusual structures another one is potentially connected to some other neural phenomena such as these unusual radio bubbles that you see right here and even though the original filaments were discovered back in the early 80s even today after four decades the actual explanation and the actual origin of these filaments is still not particularly well understood nevertheless the scientists still have learned some things about them with a lot of new studies both describing some of the features observed from these filaments and also sort of speculating on the potential Origins what I guess the first natural question being what's inside of these filaments what are they actually made out of and the answer here is somewhat surprising these filaments are most likely made out of extremely fast moving cosmic rays and specifically very fast moving electrons that seem to be moving near the speed of light with something extremely powerful accelerating these particles to very very high velocities and then as a result producing these very long stretch structures like I said some of them are 150 light years in length and some of them are also relatively thick some of these filaments are at least half a light year in thickness and so whatever is accelerating these electrons to these velocities has to be super powerful potentially being some of the most powerful astrophysical events very likely involving really really massive black holes or some really really powerful explosions but because of the way that some of these few moments are structured and the way that they're stacked on top of each other or because of the way some of them are basically side by side with each other it's still very difficult to answer if all these films are caused by the same type of an event or if they're all produced by something slightly different or possibly entirely different in other words the mystery is still a mystery but some of these new studies especially the ones you can find in the description below decided to create some of the most detailed observations of these filaments while also analyzing some of the individual ones but also studying them as a whole as well creating the very detailed and solid beautiful map you can find in the study in the description below in the process discovering approximately 10 times more filaments than we originally saw in some of the previous studies with this very beautiful but somewhat Eerie image that was produced using the data from the South African radio astronomy Observatory taking nearly three years to produce and in this case this is a radio image or basically image produced in radio frequency disease with the overall frequency being 1.28 gigahertz which essentially helped the scientists uncover quite a lot of different phenomena including some still unexplained phenomena which seem to represent either outbursts from different Stars possible Supernova remnants or some other neural phenomena such as radio nebula that you see right here and so by combining the data from some of the most powerful radio telescopes with the ability to finally remove some of the background that was essentially blocking some of these filaments the scientists were able to discover some really incredible sites we've never seen before but some of the initial investigations trying to figure out how the magnetic fields inside these filaments connect to the potential cosmic rays that could be coming from some really powerful sources in order to create these very long very beautiful features in other words the scientists are trying to figure out the exact mechanism responsible for creating these very long filaments and they are slowly get into that final answer for example some of the initial propositions from many years ago suggested that maybe these filaments are created because of some unusual Supernova that create very powerful emissions which then create these particular filaments as a result of some sort of magnetic interaction but having investigated these filaments and compared them to the Supernova observations that do have visible radio emissions as well the scientists learned that the radio emissions coming from the filaments are actually very different from the ones coming from the Supernova suggesting that their origin is probably not the same basically the Supernova are very likely not responsible for this but approximately two years ago another proposition decided to focus on a slightly different idea the idea of supermassive black holes that generally are also responsible for producing a lot of cosmic radiation a lot of cosmic rays around the universe and this actually kind of connects to the other observation from a very different type of a telescope from the X-ray telescopes the Chandra actor telescope in the last few years has also been discovering these very similar filaments but obviously in the X-ray frequencies here's actually one of many images produced by the scientists a few years ago we've discussed this in the channel in one of the previous videos and right there the red box is sort of pointing at one of these mini filaments which also seem to possess somewhat similar morphological features in other words they also look the same and so is it possible that their origin is kind of connected well the proposal from a couple years ago sort of explains how this could form in theory and in order for this to work it would just need two things a relatively powerful black hole emitting very powerful astrophysical Jets creating the so-called cosmic rays and some sort of a nebula with a lot of gas in it and so essentially as all of these cosmic rays from the astrophysical Jets start to spread away from the black hole some of them could end up Crossing some sort of a molecular cloud so basically a nebula and according to the scientists with is more explanation that you can read about in the description below the interaction between these very powerful cosmic rays and some sort of a molecular cloud is actually going to produce several different types of very very light but also very fast moving electrons with the ones that have higher energy producing x-ray filaments yet the ones that don't have as much energy producing radio filaments in essence explaining that all of these films could have been actually the signs of ancient activity of our own supermassive black hole with some of these Jets essentially hitting some of the clouds in the vicinity and producing these effects and to some extent this story makes sense mostly because very similar filaments have already been detected in other galaxies that have been previously active and some of these galaxies especially more active ones seem to have a lot more of these filaments but at the moment this is just a preliminary explanation mostly because even though the scientists have a lot of Radio Data with nearly a thousand of these filaments already detected and explored at the moment unfortunately the X-ray data is really missing there are just not a lot of extra observations or more specifically there are not a lot of accurate x-ray observations because unfortunately there are just not enough x-ray telescopes out there doing all the work and so until the scientists can start collecting more actuary observations and find more of these x-ray filaments and then possibly find a connection between these filaments and the radio filaments this particular idea is still going to be just a hypothesis and would be somewhat difficult to prove but nevertheless it's still the only reasonable explanation we currently have okay I guess it could also be aliens but it's never aliens so the only reasonable explanation we currently have although it's also possible that at least some of these filaments are maybe connected to some of the other unusual events such as various radio bubbles discovered in the past although even if we can explain their origin it's still difficult to explain how some of these filaments form in the way they form for example some of them seem to have have extremely ordered separation between the microfilaments on the inside in some of these clusters they seem to be perfectly separated by a distance of about one astronomical unit away from one another which actually sort of resembles what we usually find around the Sun the so-called Soul Loops they also tend to be extremely orderly separated and all of this is formed by the magnetic lines and so if these are the magnetic lines of the Galaxy this obviously needs a completely different explanation and would probably require a lot more thinking and a lot more observations and Analysis at the same time it's not even clear if these filaments change dramatically over time or even if they move around mostly because these observations are relatively recent and we haven't really observed any changes yet and so if there is any motion detected or any additional changes it might actually be more reasonable to assume that these have a very similar origin story to what we actually detect around the solar surface magnetic lines so definitely still a lot of unanswered questions but I guess still the biggest question is what created these how were these made and along with the other radio Mysteries we've discovered in the last few years such as various radio Bubbles and once again confirms that it's a pretty exciting time for radio astronomy a lot of new Mysteries a lot of unanswered questions and a lot of future exciting answers and exciting studies which means that we'll definitely come back to this and talk about it in some of the future videos and today we're going to be discussing some of the new discoveries and some of the more unusual discoveries in regards to the actual shape of the Milky Way galaxy and more importantly what created these unusual features that we're going to be discussing because unlike the typical representation of the Milky Way which basically makes it look like a disc shaped Galaxy with a relatively flat plane all of the modern discoveries suggest otherwise in the last few years the discoveries suggest that not only is our galaxy worked and seems to have an unusual shape for one reason or another it also seems to contain several major ripples across it formed in a very similar way to how ripples form on atypical liquid in this case because of some kind of a massive interaction with something else that used to exist here billions of years ago but as you're about to discover from the recent study we've learned that it seems to still exist here and the scientists finally know exactly what caused it and how all of this works but I guess first a little bit of History some of the initial discoveries from back in 2002 from an extremely long-running survey known as sdss slow and digital Sky survey story started to uncover a lot of interesting features not just about the entire universe but also about the Milky Way galaxy as well and specifically about certain regions in the Galaxy that seem to possess way more density than other regions representing what the scientists refer to as over densities back then the scientists discovered several different clumps with different density of stars at some of the outermost edges of the Galaxy itself and the first such structure discovered back in 2002 today is referred to as the monosaurus ring something that seems to contain approximately 100 million solar masses in total and something that seems to be about 200 000 light years long it's essentially a kind of a clumpy structure or some kind of over density that forms a ring on the outskirts of the Galaxy but this was just the beginning in 2015 in this study the scientists identified several others structures eventually discovering at least four of these ripples at different distances away from the center of the Galaxy for example there's the triadromeda ring the South Middle structure and the North near structure as well and although this was only seen in one part of the Galaxy today it's assumed that this is essentially a ring that seems to go around the Galaxy itself but because these are ripples they also seem to have very similar features with some parts going up and some parts going down and because of this it's actually relatively difficult to see the rest of the Galaxy or to be more exact to assess the exact size of the Galaxy because of the unusual overdensities present in certain regions and so back then the Assumption was that maybe our galaxy is much larger than we usually thought instead of being slightly smaller than the Andromeda it was now assumed to be anywhere between 150 to 180 000 light years across or very similar in size to the Andromeda galaxy which also imply that maybe the solar system is actually a lot closer to the center than we initially thought approximately a halfway away from the center as opposed to lying at two-thirds of the Galaxy's radius but despite the discovery it was still not clear exactly what these clumps are and more importantly how exactly they were formed some scientists speculated that maybe these are remnants known as the Stellar streams so these are usually streams left by various orbiting galaxies that used to exist here and have now been tidally disrupted by the Milky Way other scientists suggested that maybe these are just anomalies and don't exist throughout the entire galaxy yet some other scientists suggested that maybe this is due to gradational facts from something around the Milky Way with more observations revealing even more hints and specifically establishing that many of these formations were not really aligned with the disk of the Milky Way even four of these separate structures with the closest one being about 6 000 light years away from us were positioned either above or below the plane of the Milky Way galaxy but intriguing enough the distance between them was more or less sane approximately 6 000 light years in between major structures as if once again these were ripple-like structures produced by some kind of a massive interaction and once again in Finland these were ring structures with some other studies even potentially discovering what seems to be a vertical Ripple or I guess a ripple that's only invisible in this particular perspective not really a ripple that's visible from the top and a lot of these earlier studies started to imply that a lot of this seems to be kind of correlated with an orbit of another galaxy known to us discovered not so long ago and that actually includes that vertical Ripple as well I mean this study right here kind of spoils it Sagittarius dwarf Galaxy a Galaxy whose initial influence was completely unknown to us but in the last few years the scientists discovered some really intriguing things about it and it's by the way barely visible somewhere right there including the fact that it seems to have initiated major star formation in our galaxy maybe even creating the solar system and by the way things Sagittarius dwarf also more recently discovering that it seems to contain huge amounts of gamma-ray emissions possibly because of pulsars or maybe because of mysterious Dark Matter something that was initially a mysterious phenomenon inside the so-called Fermi bubbles but as we discussed in a recent video you can find in the description turned out to be the result of Sagittarius dwarf as well but more importantly the most recent study almost definitively shows that the interaction of Sagittarius dwarf Galaxy with the Milky Way almost definitively caused the ripples of the Milky Way at those specific times when the Sagittarius dwarf passed through the disk of our galaxy implying that at least twice as the Sagittarius dwarf passed through the Milky Way it caused all of the stars around it to mysteriously dislocate and oscillate at different speeds something that the scientists were able to confirm by observing the extremely accurate measurements of the motion of various Stars with the values for these terms measured by the iconic Gaia telescope and so by using the data from Gaia and also employing the technique the scientists refer to as Galactic seismology the scientists were able to compare the estimates for the interaction of Sagittarius dwarf with the current motion and the current location of various Stars here's a brief summary of what we currently believe might have happened 5.7 billion years ago and once again 1.9 billion years ago as well with the third passage and the final passage possibly occurring about a billion years ago and here's maybe another way of visualizing this by trying to compare the information history of most stars with the known parameters for the Stellar stream created by the Sagittarius dwarf Galaxy so we know that it seems to have crossed the Milky Way at least three times and this as a result created quite a lot of disturbances in the Milky Way producing the ripples that seem to have appeared around the same time as well although according to the scientists in the sleeper most of these ripples appeared during the last passage approx similarly a billion years ago implying that maybe originally there were more ripples but with time most of them seem to have dissipated and disappeared and only some remained up until now and the most recent reports are probably actually much smaller than they used to be back in the days and that's because we know that with every passage Sagittarius dwarf lost more and more mass with the last passage very likely involving the Galaxy that already lost most of its mass but even a billion years ago it was at least 20 times more massive than it currently is today it's believed to be at least a thousand times less massive than our own Galaxy meaning that most of the mass was stolen from it and deposited into the Milky Way or at least left in these Stellar streams that you see right here but I guess more importantly highlighting how extremely influential this galaxy was on the evolution of morphology or essentially the shape of the Milky Way itself it seems to have affected the star formation it might have even created our own Sun it definitely affected the formation of stars in the last billion years and it Formed these unusual ripples which though for us are kind of invisible are very likely visible from outside of the Milky Way not to mention that it also obviously contributed quite a lot of Mass to the total mass of the Milky Way afterwards but we obviously have all the dwarf galaxies orbiting around the Milky Way as well as a matter of fact the large and the small magellanic clouds that you see right there at some point you might actually have something similar going on as well they might start falling into the Milky Way produce their own sterile streams force their own star formation as well and disrupt the Galaxy even more producing even more ripples or potentially even other unusual features thus allowing our galaxy to evolve even more and then one day we're going to have one of the major collisions in the history of the Milky Way the collision with the Andromeda and the Triangular galaxies but by then planet Earth will have transformed dramatically and life will probably no longer exist here there's something really exciting about the idea of being the first explorer and the idea of exploration in general becoming the first person ever to explore something no one has ever seen before and we can only imagine today what really explorers and early cartographers of the 15th century must have felt when they were essentially discovering all of these new lands all of these new continents and we're essentially trying to map the entire planet exploring places no one has ever been to something that generally today can only be captured by things like movies books or possibly video games and although there are still some places on the planet for example places in the deep ocean that we haven't really explored yet very well and the places where the scientists even today are trying to create various maps for the most part the idea of cartography and the idea of exploring the world is something that's basically in the past or is it and that's kind of where I wanted to start this video because it looks like we now have or will have a completely new way of mapping things and a complete really new area of modern cartography something that's no longer constrained to planet Earth and something that is actually still in its infancy and is going to be exploring some of the nearby regions very close to the solar system Something That We're actually only now trying to figure out by using a lot of modern telescopes and a lot of modern Technologies now this particular video that you can find in a description is one of the most recent studies that tries to create a three-dimensional image of a well-known structure known as the Barnard zoo in the process discovering that it was very likely created by some kind of a supernova you can learn more about this in sound the links in the description but that's not what we're talking about because we're going to be talking about something even more grandiose something that several scientists have been now exploring and working on for I guess over a year and something that in my opinion kind of resurrects the idea of early cartography the idea of creating maps and exploring completely new areas that nobody has ever seen and nobody has ever visited but also probably never will mostly because a lot of these areas are really far away and we've actually talked about the first version of this I guess just over a year ago where I showed you the map itself and some of the discoveries from this map that essentially showed us the sun and the solar system right here and all of the nearby stars as well as all of the nearby important objects such as various clouds various formations that potentially were Supernova remnants and the entire neighborhood around the solar system within the vicinity of approximately 32 light years and there were some really interesting discoveries coming from this including the discoveries about the so-called local cloud and also showing us how the solar system that's right here is actually in between two different interstellar clouds and it's probably going to be entering another one but if you'd like to learn the details check out the videos somewhere in the description or somewhere right there but now a year later one of the scientists behind this paper reached out and actually mentioned that well he's been working pretty hard on the next version the version that's even more grandiose in scale and with all this becoming possible because of the cases guide telescope the incredibly powerful telescope that for the past few years has been very actively mapping the night skies and specifically producing the motion of various objects in the night skies orbiting in the same region where we currently have the James Webb Telescope LaGrange two points and very recently Gaia has released its third major release of data representing the most accurate and the most complete multi-dimensional map of the Milky Way galaxy and some of the other objects outside of the Galaxy in this case also mapping various types of dust showing the galactic disc with Stellar clusters mapping the radial velocity and the proper motion of nearly 30 million objects in the Milky Way galaxy creating maps of Interstellar dust and now also including what's known as the chemical map which allows the scientists to measure the stellar metallicity and the chemical composition of various Stars which by itself is called astrometry a way for us to measure the precise position and precise motion of different objects in the Solar system in a galaxy and even outside of the Galaxy with the telescope being so extremely precise that it even allows the scientists to measure what's known as starquakes actual Quakes on the surface of various stars and in this case this video is absolutely brilliant it actually allows us to even hear the Stars if you were to convert their pulsation into the actual sounds here's roughly what all of this sounds like [Music] [Music] and so here the dark patches that you're looking at are slightly colder compared to the bright patches with all of this creating periodic changes in the brightness of the star and so all of this is going to become super useful for studying various Stars around the solar system but because of this incredible Precision in the measurements of these different objects it also allows some of the other scientists to start mapping the nearby vicinity of the solar system and to essentially start focusing on trying to become the Modern Age cartographers they are now able to create a kind of a visual representation of a lot of different objects and a lot of different systems and a lot of unusual and somewhat difficult to explain a phenomena that seem to be happening around the solar system and even farther away all the way to the distance of several thousand light years away from us so let's take a look at what they've discovered so far so I've already showed you this map this is approximately 10 parts across or about 33 light years but imagine now that you were to zoom out well all of this the local Cloud right here is now going to be just this tiny blotch in the middle and so now we can see what's going on even farther away first of all as you can see we're basically in the local bubble but as you zoom out enough you'll start noticing that there are quite a lot of different Bubbles and a lot of different clouds all over the place and a lot of these are completely unexplored even today so all of this essentially represents Terra incognita the completely unexplored parts of the Galaxy that we're still trying to learn about and still trying to understand and honestly I'm barely familiar with most of these now some of them are more iconic like for example in this right here is the orional acro clouds with the famous Orion Nago that sort of looks like this from planet Earth but many objects around it or even the objects inside of it would be for the most part and familiar to most of us but then by looking at this as a whole you also start obviously seen that there does seem to be a slightly higher concentration of activity in certain regions for example there is a lot of dust in this region there is not so much in the local bubble and also not so much in this region either and you also realize that a lot of these dust clouds are usually associated with a lot of activity inside of them and so basically the claws themselves here represent the signs of past activity with the map legend in this case also telling us the approximate age of some of these objects some of them are really young only approximately 100 million years old whereas other ones would be billions of years old and so this bubble right here represents approximately 2 600 light years away from the solar system which also represents this part of the Galaxy so a relatively small part of the Milky Way galaxy and it also comes in two versions with the second version even shown us all the stars located here as well just in case you wanted to find out what stars are present in certain regions but that's not it there's another version that zooms out even more with this version now taken us even farther away so the local bubble once again is here now if we were to zoom out even more we'll start discovering the areas that are even barely visible to the Gaia telescope and here's what all this looks like if you were to zoom out completely so essentially that's the entire map we have right now and all of this is based on the data from the Gaia telescope or do you have to remember here that this is still a very early version and it's still in its infancy and there could be some mistakes as well but overall this looks absolutely mind-blowing so basically if we are somewhere right there with the map I showed you previously only reaching to this point which is once again approximately 2600 light years and from the center to the edge this is about 20 000 light years roughly representing the area you're about to see in this video so quite impressive quite a huge volume of space but as you can see from the detail which is sort of like in this case all of this is still in its infancy we barely know what's out there and we're really only scratching the surface when it comes to understanding what's happening in our own Galaxy and what sort of features and various structures exist in the vicinity of the solar system like for example you can see right here there are thousands and thousands of light years of various types of dust so much dust as a matter of fact that it seems to block the region behind it with only very few features located behind it that are still visible for example there's one right here this is another one right here and there are some other ones but the majority of them are completely hidden and so the outline of the feature that you can see right here that represents this very thick Cloud basically hides the rest of the galaxy from us but some parts as you can see are much lower in density in this case the scientists behind the study started to assign different names to them so we have this Bay of copper Corners we have a relatively long straight of seriousness and some other interesting regions here and there but overall though all this really reminds me of those super early maps of planet Earth from the 14th and 15th century the maps that would show the world in a completely different way from how we imagined it today and the maps that although correct to some extent would eventually change dramatically as we'll learn more about the world around us so for example this right here is the Mediterranean and this is Italy and so just like these maps changed over time I'm pretty certain all this would change as well but this is still a really really interesting first start and actually a super exciting attempt in trying to create something visual that we can kind of relate to and something that our brains can sort of understand it's a two-dimensional map of a three-dimensional environment around us with the numbers in Brackets around different objects kind of showing us how far away the object is below or above the galactic plane and since our galaxy is believed to be relatively flat the two-dimensional map here kind of makes sense as well in other words at least in theory we should be able to create a function in two-dimensional map and should be able to read it and understand it even though the actual Galaxy is obviously three-dimensional and since all this is freely available you can go and explore this using some of the links in the description below and by using one of these interactive maps your solos but as you can obviously tell this is still very very early and this is still just the beginning we've only gotten this far and so our knowledge of the Milky Way is still quite limited but we're getting there and we seem to be improving every single year this is Anton and today we're going to be talking about yet another unusual Discovery coming from the center of our own Galaxy but it's not a black hole or any other exotic object it's actually something that is quite common and something that seems to exist everywhere in the universe because of the phenomenon of the accretion disks because as you might already know a lot of things in the universe seem to possess a Christian disks that then seem to create the object itself this obviously applies to black holes and neutron stars but it also applies to different stars and it might even apply to newly born planets and based on various observations from various telescopes such as the alma telescope today it's generally believed that the accretion disks are responsible for the formation of pretty much every single low or medium mass stars and various planetary systems including of course R1 sun and pretty much most of the nearby stars as well but there's one question that a lot of scientists currently cannot answer does this also apply to some of the larger and more massive stars so here we're talking about stars that are at least 30 or maybe 15 masses of the Sun or possibly even in the hundreds for example this iconic star known as r136a1 the most massive star ever discovered is potentially over 300 masses of the Sun in Mass so was this star also created in a similar way was there also an accretion disk here as well or did the star formed by maybe collapsing into this us directly or maybe in some other way and so that's essentially the question that the scientists have been trying to answer for a pretty long time by looking at various examples out there and so very recently a team of scientists whose paper you can find in the description below was essentially exploring the center of our own Galaxy and specifically looking at the region known as the Sagittarius region the region where we have the supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A star would the black hole itself be invisible somewhere right there but the Sagittarius region doesn't just contain Sagittarius A in it it has other letters as well actually overall all this kind of looks like this so there's a lot of activity here there are quite a lot of different emissions in various frequencies but Sagittarius A star seems to be the most active of them all and this is where we know there is a black hole but as you can see there's also Sagittarius C region generally located a little bit to the right if you were to follow the galactic plane now naturally this is also an extremely active region with a lot of different activity a lot of different Stars huge amounts of gas with the overall density of space being approximately a million times higher than the space very close to the solar system or in other words there's about million times more gas than a lot of other stuff compared to what we would find in the vicinity of our own sun and when looking in this region the scientists have completely by accident identified something that looks like well basically a kind of a miniature Galaxy which made it look like a very strange object to be located in such an unusual place it's as if there was some kind of a smaller Galaxy present inside the larger galaxy The Milky Way with the total size of the subject being approximately 4 000 astronomical units across so not actually that big at all which is about six percent of one single light year making this a relatively small object but obviously much much bigger than the solar system but what exactly was this object well in theory I guess it could be some kind of a galactic Remnant or possibly some kind of a galactic object being swoled by the Milky Way which we know happened quite a lot in the past but in this case it was just way way too small compared to anything else we know exists out there most galaxies are at least a few hundred light years across this one was like a million times smaller and the main reason the scientists in this case get confused by this object is of course because of these unusual arms that it seems to possess it kind of made it resemble a typical spiral galaxy as a matter of fact we kind of think that maybe this is what the Milky Way galaxy looks like if you were to look at it from the top but when measuring this disk further and then trying to determine its mass they discovered it possesses approximately 32 masses of the Sun in total which suggested that this was basically some kind of a Proto star a baby star and it was also gravitational stable but seemed to possess these unusual arms but it didn't take them long to figure out what most likely happened here they now are pretty certain that this used to be a much larger disk and definitely resembled something we see in other star systems but something must have passed very close to this disc which makes sense because as I mentioned before this is a very dense area with a lot of different stars in the vicinity and when passing close to the disc this object Disturbed the formation of the protoplanetary disk and ended up forming these unusual spiral arms with the scientists in his case even identifying the secondary object or in other words none of this was strange unusual or mysterious in any way this was basically a result of a nearer passage between two stars or possibly a star and a baby star which as a matter of fact we believe could have happened to the solar system as well there's at least one video that should be somewhere right there or in the description that explores this concept in more detail because of the analysis of various ancient meteorites discovered across the solar system and so by disturbing the accretion disk it formed the unusual spiral arms but also captured some of its mass which could in theory result in the formation of more baby planets around this probably older star or it could result in something entirely different which means that the scientists should be probably looking at this as well but I guess more importantly what's coming out of the study is the fact that it definitively proves that a larger more massive stars seem to be also formed in the same way in other words they also seem to form using the accretion disk model mostly because the total mass here is over 32 masses of the Sun and so by the time the star has formed it will most likely form something really giant and something really bright but also something that's most likely going to go supernormal pretty quick within just a few million years but the other impressive thing here is the fact that all this is located about 26 000 light years away from us and also in the region that's generally really difficult to see there's just so much dust here that generally hides a huge proportion of the Galaxy from our view but in this case they were able to see identify and even measure the mass and the size of both of these objects with a smaller star being approximately three masses of the Sun and mass although all this was discovered not by looking at these objects but by running simulations and trying to create the scenario where the scientists could also create these unusual arms in the model version of their protoplanetary disk and it seems to have worked and they seem to have determined that this is pretty much the only way where you can produce these unusual arms without breaking any major laws of physics with all this very likely happening approximately 12 000 years ago with the other important Discovery in this case being the fact that this is the first Port of planetary disc discovered in the center of our own Galaxy which of course means that this region definitely possesses new stars and the stars that are created and destroyed in a very similar way to Stars we find in other parts of the Galaxy and we find everywhere around us despite the fact that this is such a dense region with so much activity and so much potential for the destruction of any new object but because of this first discovery it also might suggest that there could be more similar objects discovered in some of the future studies with many of them very likely still being hidden by all of this dust and so it's only a matter of time before the scientists discover something else really exciting and really unusual today when we generally think of a galaxy we kind of Imagine something that looks like this a structure that's mostly composed of starks that are visible to us and that generally produce quite a lot of light that's that visible from very far away distances with a classical image of the Milky Way being something like this as well and then from the side you would maybe resemble something like this althoughly we know that it's generally also kind of worked and has quite a lot of ripples all over the place but what about the things that we don't see what about things like for example black holes neutron stars various types of gas various types of relatively hard to detect particles and everything else that makes a typical Galaxy well that is of course not as easily visible as a matter of fact none of this is simulated here or in any other media that we generally use to explain science or to explain the universe hole in four percent this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing one of the first Maps or I guess one of the first 3D images of essentially what the Galaxy most likely looks like if we were to look at it imagining things that we don't see or at least imagining things that we know exist but are just not visible the remnants such as black holes or various types of neutron stars that at least theoretically We Believe should be all over the place but we only have found a handful in the last few decades and mostly because they're just impossible to see we can only see them if they're absorbing a lot of Mass from the partner and are then re-emitting this mass in for example x-rays or if they're producing very unusual observational effects such as gravitational Landing effects which are also extremely rare and relatively difficult to see but theoretically the scientists believe that there are millions if not billions of these objects out there and they should also be considered to be part of the Galaxy and so to try to figure out what all of this looks like the scientists ran a few models a few simulations made a few assumptions in regards to what happens to these objects once they're created from for example a typical cyprinova and then map this overlaying the typical picture of the Milky Way galaxy see producing the map of what the scientists refer to in their paper as a galactic Underworld the view of the Galaxy where we serve only see the objects that are unseen to us neutron stars and black holes the remnants of various Supernova that happened over the past 13 billion years and though in the past the scientists have discovered several neutron stars and black holes around the recent sites of various Supernova this represents only a tiny tiny number compared to the total that exists out there with pretty much the vast majority of them now being almost completely invisible and today we know that all of the stars out there at some point are going to transform into some kind of a Remnant the majority of them are just going to become some sort of a wide dwarf basically exactly what happens to our sun as well and eventually this will turn into a black dwarf as they cool down over time although in this case trillions of years but stars that there are at least 10 solar masses are going to explode producing something else as a result the ones that are less than 25 solar masses are going to end up as neutron stars with vast majority being completely invisible to us but some becoming posters or potentially some other neural Stars such as magnetaries the stars that are more than 25 solar masses are going to produce black holes and some of the most massive stars might actually leave nothing behind it might go through something known as parent stability Supernova basically destroying themselves entirely but things like white dwarf we can generally see and can also detect them from relatively far away distances and also because white dwarfs don't experience Supernova they generally also stay in the same area of space and if you were to remove every other star and just leave wide Wars behind he would produce a relatively similar ship but obviously much much dimmer overall but because neutron stars and black holes are formed from Supernova this also adds a bit of a kick to them having them actually get displaced across the Galaxy and thus creating a map that's very different from what we have in terms of regular stars and so this scientists that produce this new model took all of this into consideration so for example they looked at the distribution of various stars in our galaxy right now and also looked at some of the more massive stars in our galaxy simulating where we can find most of them and how most of them will end up changing their orbit over time but they also took into consideration the fact that a typical Supernova will give them a bit of a kick into a random Direction with some of the Stars potentially reaching very high velocities and because many of them might even be older than the majority of the stars in the galaxy they might have actually traveled across the Milky Way for nearly 13 billion years and so even though typical Stars might resemble something like this with each of the points representing some kind of a star-like object the so-called Galactic underworld would look entirely different the distribution of these Stars across the galactic plane create something that's at least three times thicker than was produced by the visible stars if we were to colorize this it would look something like this here's what we think Milky Way might look like although in this case it's kind of simplified but here's what the galactic underworld looks like if you were to remove all of the stars leaving only neutron stars and black holes behind and more intriguingly they discovered that at least a third of these Stars possess velocity is high enough to actually escape the Galaxy implying that a large proportion of all of these neutron stars and black holes is actually escaping the Galaxy and at some point are going to end up completely by themselves traveling in The Intergalactic space which also means that many of them already are there and potentially create quite a lot of invisible Mass between various Galactic objects for example between the Andromeda and the Milky Way and this also implies that over time the Milky Way seems to be actually decreasing in Mass I guess in some sense you could call it evaporating and though that's kind of expected of other objects such as typical Global clusters or a lot of other star clusters that can over time lose their mass and a lot of the Stars present here mostly because of the gravitational interactions nobody ever thought that it would be possible for the Milky Way itself to actually lose its mass in a similar way and in this case it does seem to be pretty significant I mean we're talking about a third of all of these massive objects which of course if confirmed by other studies would actually present an interesting opportunity to study how galaxies lose Mass over time and potentially explain some of the Mysteries in regards to some observations that suggest that there is definitely some Mass missing in various galaxies so there's definitely a few Mysteries to be sold here assuming of course the simulations are correct and another intriguing Discovery in this case was the fact that many of these Romans seem to be distributed relatively equally across the Galaxy so just in that pretty much most of the stars in the galaxy should actually have at least one of these remnants within at least 100 light years away from the Star and that suggests that for our sun The Remnant should be within about 65 light years at the most which means that it might actually even be closer but because it would not be emitting any light or produce any energy whatsoever it would be practically impossible to detect it at the moment and so some of the upcoming observations from the Vera Ruben Observatory might actually help us find some of these objects and thus resolve some of these Mysteries as well this Observatory is going to be the most powerful we have right now and being able to track various objects using gravitational lensing effects something that we usually use to attack various planets but something that can also be used to obviously detect black holes as well but I guess the biggest surprise here is just how different the shape is from what the Galaxy looks like by looking at regular Stars this actually kind of reminds me of a typical elliptical galaxy compared to this galaxy like what we think Milky Way most likely is with the overall increase in density as you move away from the disc mostly being created by the interaction with various objects but also because of these kicking effects from various Supernova and so that final moment before the object becomes a black hole or a neutron star definitively determines where he's going to spend the rest of its time as it travels the Galaxy as a matter of fact in the past at least 20 different hyper velocity stars have been discovered across the Milky Way and most of them are believed to have acquired their velocity because of various Supernova but the majority of the objects being kicked out are very likely neutron stars and not so much black holes that's once again because of the total mass a black hole is more likely to be a lot more massive and thus influenced a lot less by the Supernova which of course suggests that after billions of years the objects that are going to be mostly left in a galaxy are going to be black holes and of course various wide worlds but nearly 40 percent of neutron stars because of that Supernova kick end up escaping the Galaxy which of course suggests that the intergalactic space could actually be filled with various neutron stars flying all over the place but because these Supernova are so unpredictable and create what's known as asymmetric explosions or asymmetric kicks could be in any direction if you compare these pictures once again you'll notice that even the galactic arms seem to appear from his image and so this right here could be what the future of the Milky Way will be like in the next 10 to 20 billion years as soon of course the universe survives that long and that also of course means that when we look at various elliptical galaxies such as for example the largest one known to us the galaxy known as ic1101 what you're looking at here are mostly red dwarfs a lot of white dwarfs but also quite a lot of invisible black holes and very likely lots and lots of neutron stars Escape in this galaxy once again assuming that the study in this case is correct in the assumptions that were made to simulate this but of course what all this means for the future of the universe and the future of the Milky Way is not really known to us I'm sure a lot of studies will try to investigate this in more detail and possibly even find some of these neutron stars as they escape the Galaxy but at least for now we know that if we only discover some unusual admissions somewhere out there somewhere where they shouldn't be happening and if we actually find the effects coming from a distant Pulsar it might actually finally make sense if the study in this case is correct in 1968 one of the U.S satellites completed by accident discovered that there was an unusual gamma-ray glow coming from the center of our own Galaxy specifically from the constellation of Sagittarius would more and more of this excess gamma ray glow discovered over the last few decades and even today this is actually still one of the bigger mysteries of our own Galaxy there seems to be a tremendous amount of gamma ray glow coming from certain regions of the Galaxy and specifically from the central regions you're about to see in this video and unfortunately even today nobody actually understands what exactly is causing all of this and how exactly any of this works but there are at least two major theories and both of them have been discussed on this channel before whole wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing one of the main theories and one of the recent studies that seems to want to confirm this once and for all explaining what's most likely causing this and how we can potentially explain all of this using standard physics without breaking any loss and also without proposing any unusual phenomena that we cannot prove and by the way that original detection of gamma ray glow from 1968 the article for which you can find in the description below was discovered using some of the first ever scientific satellites in this case one known as oso3 orbiting solar Observatory the third such satellite and it actually possessed a very interesting experiment from the MIT University whose main purpose was to look for unusual gamma ray radiation somewhere out there but over the years more and more unusual radiation was detected from certain regions and eventually the scientists were able to produce the gamma ray map we have today when one of the most iconic Maps being created with the participation from the Fermi telescope this is the map you see right here but back in 2009 there was this paper based on some of the observations from the ferment telescope that clearly identified that there was unusual excess of gamma rays in certain regions of the Galaxy see where in theory we do expect to have very high concentrations of dark matter the mysterious stuff that we believe exists all over the universe and today the scientists refer to this as the galactic center GV access gev stands for Giga electron volts or the energy of a typical gamma ray and so back in the days specifically a decade ago this was one of the bigger proofs for the potential existence of Dark Matter extremely close to the center of the Galaxy and this idea relied on dark matter being some kind of a particle specifically the particle known as wimps weakly interacting massive particle and so in this case by having a wind particle and a Wim antiparticle annihilate they might end up producing a lot of radiation including cameras and so even though not a lot of wimps would be doing this on the outskirts in the so-called Dark Matter Halo due to the much higher concentration near the center of the Galaxy we would expect quite a lot of them doing so right here and so that was one of the potential actual explanations but because this area is also extremely crowded with a lot of different stuff a lot of different Stars a lot of different types of gas a lot of activity and interaction and generally represents a very hectic and very energetic region there could also be other explanations as well these gamma rays could technically be produced by pretty much anything and so in the last few years or in the last decade or so the scientists were desperately trying to answer so exactly what could it be that produces these gamma rays as a matter of fact further discoveries determined that this unusual detection here wasn't actually very smooth and if it were a dark matter you would expect it to be sort of spread out relatively equally but in this case GCE or galactic center access was kind of clumpy it was basically chunky almost as if there were chunks of matter that seem to represent much higher density of gamma rays compared to everything else and some studies even suggested that it was sort of Representative of some sort of a point source but generally there is a limit to what can produce gamma rays so in some sense it could be a lot of very active black holes but that was way too many to be explained by simple theories or simpler observations however this new paper that was released not so long ago presents this other explanation that has been going around for a pretty long time as well it provides a lot of evidence that it's most likely a huge amount of different pulsars and we're talking about like at least a hundred thousand or probably even more and each one of them possesses quite a lot of energy and is able to produce very powerful gamma rays through the interaction with nearby matter but pulsers were some of the primary culprits for this a few years ago and one of the papers in 2017 actually found a reason to reject this as a potential explanation but the main reason for the rejection being the fact that nobody expected there to be so many posters in this region I know that we know that certain posters are definitely able to produce gamma rays the vast majority of posters detected not so far from planet Earth are only able to mostly emit x-rays so gamma-ray emitting posters are actually kind of rare at least in our vicinity but the famous pulsers like the develop Pulsar you see right here do meet the gamma rays quite frequently and quite periodically but the question is can there actually be so many of them in a relatively small volume of space can there be hundred thousand of these in the central region well one way for these posters to generate gamma rays is by having extremely powerful magnetic fields or by having a slightly different formation story compared to some of the posters near us for example one way to generate certain really powerful pulsars is actually by having a wide dwarf system first and specifically a binary system with two relatively common Stars where both turn into white dwarfs and then one of these wide Works keeps stealing some of the maps from its partner and eventually it becomes a neutron star or a pulsar and so by having a pulser slash white dwarf system and by having roughly around 100 000 of these objects in a relatively small volume of space in theory this could explain the observations were seen and more specifically it could also explain another mystery from some other studies studies like this one that you can also find in the description below that detected some of the more unusual microwave Haze visible with some other telescopes and also located in a relatively similar region with this he is also possibly being created by these particular objects once again because of the interaction between a white dwarf and an extremely powerful pulsar and all of the magnetic fields that are present here and so at least in theory by having approximately 100 000 of these binary systems with pulsar and a white Wharf in there the galactic center XS could be explained and also could explain some other observations with only one unanswered question here how could hundred thousand such systems be created in this particular region and is this just extremely common way for different star systems to sort of end their existence turning into wide dwarf binaries were occasionally one of the white dwarfs becomes a neutron star because of the absorption of mass now we know that pretty much the majority of stars in the Milky Way are binary and many of them are of the mass where they will turn into white works so having so many wide worlds in that region is not really surprising but it would be a little bit surprising that so many of these binary white Wars do end up as a neutron star and a wide dwarf system that end up having these really extreme interactions with extremely powerful energy being produced in the process it's obviously not impossible but it is nevertheless kind of unusual and also unlike the explanation involving Dark Matter particles that have still not been discovered it doesn't really require any new physics or any unusual explanations and although originally the Dark Matter scientists use this gamma-ray access as a very definitive proof of the existence of Darkness better if this beeper is correct Dark Matter explanation could actually not be very good anymore especially because wimps have not been discovered even in 2022 posters however could be a really good explanation especially because of the clumpiness of this unusual region and because this also explains some of the other observations as well all the chances are even for the next few years we might not actually have a real answer this is still a big mystery and it's a mystery that we're not going to be able to answer until further investigations using other frequencies or even better gamma-ray telescopes which are not really happening anytime soon and because pretty much all the dark matter experiments on planet Earth so far have not really found any wimps that other explanation using hundred thousand pulsers right now is really our best bet hello wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing some new discoveries in regards to our own galaxy The Milky Way and more specifically the morphology or the shape of the Milky Way because once again something was discovered about the Milky Way suggesting that our original perception of what Milky Way might look like might have been a little bit incorrect okay what do I mean by that well if you were to Google Milky Way you'll see something that looks like this this is what our stereotype of the Milky Way is right now but because we're basically looking at the Galaxy from the inside it's practically impossible for us to visualize this because all we're seeing is this and so identifying the actual shape of our galaxy has been actually a priority for many decades now but it's still very very difficult but thanks to some of the new advances in telescope technology and more specifically really one single Mission the isas or European space agency's guide telescope has been accurately mapping the distance to various stars for a few years now more and more studies started to come out allowing us to calculate distances to various objects extremely precisely and thus start to create various three-dimensional Maps working out certain structures in the Galaxy itself and because of these advances coming from the Gaia telescope that's why essentially we were able to discover so many new features of the Milky Way galaxy in the last few years and this year alone there have been a lot of different videos or a lot of different topics that I've covered essentially helping us realize that the Milky Way is a little bit different from what we imagined all of these videos are going to be popping up somewhere right there at some point and so anyway so now we have some more discoveries and a few more discoveries suggesting something else that we didn't really realize about the Milky Way and this first discovery comes from the region away from the center of the Galaxy the region that's usually referred to as the galactic anti-center so basically if we're here and this is the center now we're talking about what's on the other side in the dimmer regions on the outskirts of the Galaxy itself the edge of the Galaxy if you want to refer to it that way and here's sort of what this region looks like but it's always been somewhat difficult to study this region because well we're basically inside the disk of the Galaxy and there's a lot of dust here this entire region of the so-called Galactic midplane where we're also located right now as well generally has a tremendous amount of dust all over the place that also interferes with a lot of different observations especially away from the center of the Galaxy but it's not because it it's like fog hiding stars for example it's actually because the dust in front of the Stars ends up interfering where the emissions from the stars and makes it extremely difficult to calculate the exact parameters of those stars for example if I want to discover this certain distance to a star we really have to get the direct light from it but if there's dust in between us the calculations in this case become a lot less accurate and because of this it's always been difficult to study this region but a lot of theoretical studies predicted the existence of various types of small filamental structures to some extent may be so much similar to the ones you see right here although these are produced by magnetic fields that could potentially exist in the outer disk of the Milky Way and form through the interaction with various satellite galaxies that would either Collide or possibly even get absorbed by the Milky Way through billions of years of interaction with some of the more extreme versions of this usually referred to as the Stellar screens a lot of these have been discovered in the past and how of them seem to be connected with ancient dwarf galaxies that either got absorbed or somehow interacted with the Milky Way but the theoretical calculations also suggest that smaller such structures on the outskirts at the edges of the Milky Way from the interactions with various small galaxies yet interestingly this new analysis revealed something the scientists did not expect it revealed a tremendous number of these structures way way more than they expected would just sound invisible right here as these lines you see on the screen and the existence of these very very large filamentary disk structures that seem to be presents all over the mid plane of our galaxy at least in these numbers is currently very difficult to explain for example here there seem to be seven of them with this by the way being the large magellani cloud and the small magellani Cloud this right here is the bridge connecting them and this large formation represents Sagittarius dwarf Galaxy that we'll discussed in some of the previous videos that's currently being broken apart by by our own Galaxy either we though just a number of these formations is kind of difficult to explain but it probably does have something to do with some of the other galaxies being broken apart by the Milky Way as well with one explanation suggesting that maybe these are just tight arms from various interaction between the Milky Ways disc and various satellite galaxies that somehow Disturbed it one way or another since there are so many different satellite galaxies the Milky Way has cost about 50. it's sort of expected that a lot of them will create some kind of deformation in the disk but as we've discussed in one of the previous videos a lot of these Galaxies have never actually been in this vicinity so many of them have never interacted with the Milky Way which means that maybe this was created by some of the other galaxies that used to exist and were eventually absorbed by the Milky Way itself and some of the previous investigations of similar streams that were detected a few years ago so just so that many of these stars are extremely old they're basically over 8 billion years old this means of course that's a lot of this interaction probably happened a long long time ago or maybe all of this is somehow related to the Discovery from a few years ago that suggested that our galaxy somewhat worked and has these unusual formations at the outskirts which could then create these very large distortions at the edge of the Galaxy which we're now observing as these unusual formations or these unusual filaments in other words it's currently anyone's guess what is clear however at least from these studies is that the edge of our galaxy is far from being quiet it it seems to indicate a lot of exciting activity a lot of different types of impacts a lot of different kicking around and a lot of different types of mixing of materials which potentially created all sorts of different filaments and so if I were to use my very poor Photoshop skills to try to illustrate this using this Milky Way image instead of being very orderly and very even as you see it here it's probably full of different disturbances all sorts of unusual filaments all sorts of unusual spiky formations with all of this being a sign of billions of years of interaction between various satellite galaxies and the Milky Way OK that's probably not what it looks like but I tried my best but they're just one of these discoveries about the edge of the Galaxy there was another Discovery also around the same time and also from the same data but this time about one of the galactic arms of the Milky Way that's actually one of the most well studied arms to begin with the Perseus arm you see right here with the sun itself being located in this region and once again if we actually look at our current understanding of the Milky Way galaxy the way we think it looks it might possess these very orderly very nicely shaped arms but basically this being the stereotypical image from a typical textbook but because we didn't really have Gaia telescope data up until recently nobody really knew how well structured and how orderly all this appeared from a distance or basically if you were to look at our galaxy from the top and interestingly for the study the scientists decided to rely on a combination of Gaia telescope data and all of that dust that I previously mentioned the observations from the dust actually helped the scientists discover what all of this looks like and in this case by creating a 3D map of dust located in a certain part of the Galaxy we can generally use this to examine a large collection of stars and where these stars are located and so by using three-dimensional gas maps created by another team and combining this with new observations of various molecular clouds that are usually connected to these dust clouds the scientists were able to work out the actual shape of Perseus Galactic arm which then allowed them to create a three-dimensional reconstruction of what the entire arm might sort of look like and although all of the previous work suggested the arm was very well defined and had a very specific structure this study presented a completely different image all of the gas that was previously believed to be located in the same region was actually much much farther away from one another suggesting of course that the arm might actually be Just an Illusion or it at least does not have a very distinct and very narrow shape the authors refer to this as a clumpy chaotic formation and in this case a lot of this material seems to stretch at a distance of about 10 000 light years even though it was believed to be in a relatively similar region of space which the scientists behind this paper suggest that well maybe at least this region of the Galaxy although possibly even other regions seem to resemble another galaxy we're very familiar with the galaxy known as M83 or Massey 83 that possesses arms that do have a lot of bricks a lot of irregular shapes in them and overall seems to be extremely mysterious as well because a lot of these formations also present a lot of different types of activity a big number of supernova a big number of different star formation regions but it also seems to contain a double nucleus in the center which to some extent might explain why these arms are not as defined although at the moment because this is just a completely brand new discovery nobody really has any idea what's going on and why precious arm seems to be so disorganized and so chaotic and so for all we know maybe some of the arms are disorganized but other ones might be more structured and so if I get back to my Photoshop skills here we now also have to sort of destroy or disassemble the Perseus arm we with my new Milky Way version resembling something like this definitely more of a Picasso here than Rembrandt anyway I'm just bad at Art so what all of these studies suggest to us is that well we still are basically learning about the morphology of the Milky Way and the last five years and a lot of different studies using Gaia telescope have been absolutely instrumental in discovering the true image of our galaxy it does not seem to be this simple shape it doesn't seem to be so organized and so well defined it clearly contains a lot of filaments and a lot of this organization on the inside and also some of its arms might not be well defined hold for person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing some of the new discoveries in regards to the unusual shape of R1 galaxy The Milky Way because even though most of the simulations and most of these simple images make it look maybe something like this in reality it seems to be very different from this very very different with the new discovery from the study you can find in the description below focusing on the shape of what's known as the Stellar Halo and also discovering that it seems to be quite tilted quite stretched and sort of resembles an egg potentially broken in at least two different places and also tilted to the rest of the Galaxy but why exactly does it look like this and what exact way are we looking at here well that's what I'm going to be explaining now so first of all when it comes to observing the shape of our galaxy it is obviously really challenging we're looking at everything from within the Galaxy and we're trying to understand what the shape of the entire galaxy is by observing individual stars and by then trying to combine all of this into a three-dimensional map now thank thanks to the incredible guide telescope the scientists have been slowly getting better and better at this and were actually able to map quite a lot of stars already finding the exact distances to a lot of different objects in the Milky Way but this is a pretty slow process and it's also not a process that can be applied to All of the Stars especially at farther away distances and so in this case the scientists behind the study had to combine some of these observations with a separate survey known as H3 Hector shell in a Halo at higher resolution a survey that's also been collected data on a lot of distant Stars including their chemical composition and so over time a lot of these surveys helped us understand that even though we think the Galaxy might look something like this or basically something like this like a typical this galaxy web server from a distance the reality is a little bit more complicated first of all as we've discussed before the Galaxy seems to be worked quite dramatically with the warp itself very likely being caused by a dramatic collision with another galaxy billions of years ago the results of this Collision are also visible in various streams I have already been discovered by various surveys we refer to these as Stellar streams and essentially represent ancient Galaxy that basically fell apart as they slowly got absorbed by the Milky Way leaving behind just a few stars and potentially some kind of a core here are some of the most recent ones discovered not so long ago with a lot of these Global clusters that you see very likely representing some of these ancient chorus or leftovers from other galaxies that used to orbit and eventually got absorbed but on top of this as you can see there is also a kind of a Halo there's an inner Halo and an outer Halo and when it comes to galactic heroes generally there are three different concepts here there is the mysterious dark Mary Halo that all of the galaxies seem to possess and what the scientists use to explain the rotation of various galaxies but that's of course the concept that's a little bit more controversial with some of the other scientists then we have the huge amounts of gas or the gas Halo that's essentially mostly hydrogen but also a lot of other gases released from various Supernova or a lot of other events that essentially distributed the gas across the Galaxy and even threw it outside of the Galaxy but then finally we also get the Stellar Halo or essentially a lot of ancient stars that for one reason or another got basically a jacket from the Galaxy and are now orbiting in very peculiar ways so three separate Concepts O3 called Hill but generally all three studied in very different ways but when it comes to visual observations of galaxies it's really only the Stellar Hill that we usually see I think the iconic image from the Sombrero Galaxy kind of helps you visualize this a little bit better so this whole glowing halo around the Galaxy all of this is formed by individual Stars we don't really get to see the gas it's only visible in other frequencies and we obviously don't really know much about dark matter or how to observe it either and so when we do mention a shape of a galaxy we usually just talk about the Stellar Halo in this case in the Sombrero Galaxy it does appear to be more or less symmetrical and distributed in a relatively equal way with the Galaxy itself also been relatively flat but it seems to be that the Milky Way is not and looks very different from this with a very detailed observations from the study using roughly around 5500 Halo stars at distances going all the way to about 200 000 light years away from the center reviewing that the shape here is very unusual first of all it seems to be tilted but it also seems to resemble a kind of an egg and even here the egg itself seems to be somewhat weirdly shaped and has several breaks inside of it and that's very different from what we always believed or from what the scientists even expected it essentially means that even this picture now has to be changed not only is the disc worked but also Halo itself seems to be shifted and potentially has a lot more layers and a lot more parts inside of it with the egg shape itself tilted by approximately 25 degrees but interestingly this is not the first time this was implied even five years ago this particular study right here suggested that the hero was probably some kind of an ellipsoid but I guess the question is why well the answer to this maybe comes from some of the previous observations of that tilt and a lot of these streams we've discussed previously so unlike the sombrero right here the reason we have the Tilt and the warp and the reason there are so many streams is of course because of really massive collisions in the past and the one that was probably most influential in the past that happened a few billion years ago is the Collision that left the marks that you see right here these are all individual starts from the Galaxy we sometimes referred to as the Gaia sausage although most scientists refer to it as just the sausage Galaxy also referred to as the Enceladus Galaxy or guy Enceladus and this galaxy collided with the Milky Way a few billion years ago but potentially this being its core that's still around and is still orbiting around the Milky Way this is a cluster known as ngc2808 with this simulation right here kind of showing us what might have happened a few billion years ago so this particular Galaxy because of its mass and because of its relatively large amount of stars and a lot of other stuff very likely resulted in the the work we're observing and the distribution of a lot of other matter around the Milky Way in the end create something that you see right here with the Stars that came from this galaxy orbiting around the Milky Way at an angle of approximately 25 degrees and also in a similar Direction and similar orientation to what we have right here and so this of course suggests that this particular guy is sausage Collision very likely completely reshaped the Milky Way making it look extremely different from everything else for billions and billions of years and even though we technically expect a Galaxy to maybe reform after all of this time and potentially resemble something a little bit more spherical the fact that it doesn't just means that the sausage Galaxy was extremely massive something we discussed in the past and something you can learn more about in one of the videos in the description and so in this case it just means that these two galaxies collided at an angle which then resulted in unusual shapes Inside the Milky Way which also then resulted in the misshaped hill including very likely the gas hail and the Mysterious dark matter but because in this case we can only see the stars at least for now that's the only thing we can study and that's the only thing we can use to assess the overall shape although intriguously enough the fact that it's somewhat elliptical and not particularly spherical implies that when the Galaxy is collided because of various interactions within the Milky Way the Stars seem to have formed two different orbits or at least two orbits and eventually got spread out across a much wider region although because these are all new discoveries at the moment it's not really clear exactly how the stars were orbiting or what additional effects this had on our galaxy and various structures around it hello wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing some of the new discoveries and new Revolutions in regards to this unusual phenomenon coming from our own galaxy The Milky Way known as the Fermi bubbles the unusual formations discovered back in 2010 and then rediscovered in different frequencies only a couple of years ago the formations that the scientists believe are a direct sign that back in the days not so long ago our galaxy was extremely active and very likely produced extremely powerful Jets maybe even turning our galaxy in what we sometimes refer to as a quasar but in this case we don't really know what effects this had on anything in the galaxy and we obviously don't understand if this had any effects on planet Earth and so this recent study kind of presents us with a few answers about Sony's potential questions while also connecting several other discoveries into one single event and so let's begin with a bit of a history to help you understand what all this means back in 2008 Nas and several other agencies launched the very very productive Fermi telescope the telescope that was responsible for discovering a lot of different gamma-ray emissions across the entire universe here's for example one of its many discoveries the gamma rays coming from the famous Vela pulsar and for about 13 years now it's been watching the skies and discovering new things but back in 2010 he was able to observe an unusual formation right in the center of our galaxy the formation that kind of resembled a typical bubble these two formations today are referred to as Fermi bubbles because of the telescope that was responsible for discovering them with these huge structures being several thousand light years across and being produced by extremely fast moving particles most likely cosmic rays which can be only detected in high energy gamma rays but since the original Discovery it was not particularly clear what might have created this then approximately 10 years after the discovery of this the scientist discovered something else and in completely different frequencies and in this case instead of using a gamma-ray telescope it was a discovery made in the x-rays and the discovery made with the telescope known as erosita a telescope was discussed in one of the previous video is available right there or in the description below now unfortunately and this is a bit of a side note this telescope was turned off because of the war in Ukraine and because this was actually a collaboration between German scientists and Russian scientists we don't really know when and if this is going to become operational but for now this is maybe the end of its Mission nevertheless during its few years of operation he was able to make some incredible discoveries in the x-rays of things that were previously invisible to us and as you can see from this image it's sort of discovered another set of bubbles the bubbles we now refer to as erosita bubbles because the name of the telescope was eurozita and we've discussed this in more detail in one of the previous videos but the thing is this is actually an incredible Discovery for several different reasons first of all when it was originally found in 2020 the scientists realized it was connected to another structure that was actually already known to us the structure that you see right there known as the North Pole or spur it seemed that the polar spur in this case might have actually been part of the bubble but nobody knew what it represented simply because the telescopes were not powerful enough back then as a matter of fact here's what all this looked like in the x-rays prior to the data from the erosita that's of course the Milky Way galaxy in the x-rays but more incredibly as the scientists compared the data to the Fermi telescope they discovered that these two structures were basically on top of each other with the X-ray structure being a lot larger overall all of this sort of looked like this when the solar system visible right there on the right now in this case the Fermi bubbles were approximately half as big with the larger erosita bubbles being approximately 25 000 light years in height but because this was only visible in the x-rays it also meant that it was made out of completely different stuff unlike the ferment bubbles that were most likely made out of cosmic rays which is basically highly charged particles in most cases protons moving extremely fast the X-ray bubbles or Rosita bubbles were simply made out of extremely hot gas most likely hydrogen gas but in this case not charged particles not cosmic rays nevertheless because these two structures overlapped one another and were most likely coming from the center of the Galaxy it was always suggested that this was probably a result of powerful explosions from the center of the Milky Way from Sagittarius a-star black hole but there were several other explanations including potentially a lot of supernova happening at the same time because of a sudden star formation somewhere in the region in other words it was not entirely clear what created these Bubbles and more importantly if it was the same event or different events and all this because it was seen in different frequencies and contained different stuff if it was created by different events these events might have happened millions of years apart and as a matter of fact it wasn't even clear when these bubbles were formed and how long they actually stayed in this region and if they were going to disappear anytime soon although as a side note the detection on these bubbles by themselves is not really unusual these structures have been seen in other galaxies and I think the best example of this is from a galaxy known as ngc379 and in this case these super bubbles were also discovered in the x-rays with the supermassive black hole most likely being responsible for their production the bubbles themselves are relatively large as well a few thousand light years across and at least in terms of shape do resemble the ones we find in our own Galaxy at least to some extent but in this case the scientists investigating this galaxy discovered that this is very likely a repeated event it seems to happen every 10 million years or so with the most recent bubble that you see right here being created approximately a million years ago but in terms of size being approximately 10 times smaller than the one in the Milky Way with the supermassive black hole in the middle of this galaxy most likely being the culprit behind this it's approximately 2.4 million masses of the Sun in Mass or roughly around half the mass of the one that we have and so I guess the natural next question here is okay well if this is the same type of an event forming this is this what happened in a Milky Way was it basically some kind of a rebubbling event that happens every few million years potentially massive super new events or something coming from the center of the black hole so in other words it was always kind of curious to the scientists what exactly is causing these super bubbles in different galaxies to repeat over and over with the primary question in this case being are these two different events millions of years apart and that's precisely the question that the scientists behind this recent study decided to answer they wanted to find out if this was the same event and if it was the same event how exactly did it progress and in this case the scientists decided to model this and to run a computer simulation just to see if they can recreate a similar formation using a model with the simulation in this case being able to focus on the interaction of different types of high energy gas producing x-rays with various types of cosmic rays producing gamma rays and according to the conclusions in this paper it's very likely the same event it's very likely a single event a single powerful event that consumed anywhere from a thousand to ten thousand solar masses within a period of approximately 100 000 years which then released all these huge amounts of energy creating these two massive bubbles with all this starting approximately 2.6 million years ago and know this video likely results in an extremely powerful Jets sort of similar to what we detect from a lot of other galaxies so just in of course that our galaxy resembles something like this for some time and according to their simulation when huge amounts of matter started falling into the central black hole the resulting pressure from the Jets started to inflate the giant bubbles that then were formed around the Galaxy which pushed all of the matter that was closer to the center all across the Galaxy and in this case the solid burst also seemed to have inflated the bubbles in different phases with the first phase most likely producing very powerful Jets which quickly accelerated all of the matter away from the central black hole and as these Jets moved farther and farther away they started to fill up the spaces We Now call Fermi bubbles that's essentially why we have so many gamma rays coming from there because the actual cosmic rays the actual protons charged protons got stuck in that region but while the Fermi bubbles were expanding in across the Galaxy they also started to push a lot of the gas that was already nearby that ended up creating an enormous shock wave that's visible today with this Shockwave resulting in a lot of really heated gas which is what's visible right here in the X-rays and so basically the hydrogen gas that's emitting x-rays was just pushed away from the center by the huge pressure created by all of the cosmic rays coming from the black hole center with the study also implying that it would be impossible for any type of a supernova event even if there were many Supernova to produce something like this all of this very likely lasted for approximately 100 000 years and seems to be the best explanation right now for how all of this was created but I guess what's not clear yet is is this kind of similar to what happened in this particular Galaxy and more importantly is this something that happens a lot with the most important question in this case what effects did this have on our planet and our solar system because this happened 2.6 million years ago we don't really have enough data to suggest that it affected our planet in any way but since this was such a powerful event that's visible from planet Earth the scientists in this case would love to find out if this does have any effect on anything for example maybe it could change our atmosphere at the moment none of this is known to us yet either way definitely an exciting Discovery and an exciting study and definitely another solution to a very old mystery hello wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be talking about yet another unusual discovery of some sort of a really large structure from our own galaxy The Milky Way and as you might know there have been quite a lot of these discoveries in the last few months naturally the question here is why and the answer is well because of the new telescopes providing all of the data and some of these telescopes such as the iconic esa's Gaia telescope has been doing such an amazing job in the last few years that we suddenly had a huge amount of new discoveries coming in just a few months with many of these discoveries being right next door to us and we've talked about many of them in 2021 and you can actually find them at some point somewhere above my head this should be popping up throughout this video and some of them are also in the description below but this time the scientists have found another unusual structure and potentially the largest structure we found in the last few years they refer to it as Maggie Maggie filmon technically you can kind of see it right there and this is where where we are located so essentially Maggie or Maggie filament is one of the longest filaments hydrogen filaments discovered to date it's also relatively far from us it's about 55 000 light years away from us and forms a structure that's nearly 4 000 light years in length and approximately 130 light years in widths and in the past all of the other similar filaments or clouds discovered in the Milky Way have always been approximately 800 light years in length which is about a fifth of the size of what this is but the thing is because in this case we're not looking at stars but are actually looking at gas the scientists cannot use the data from guide telescope they have to use data from somewhere else in this case they use the data from the survey known as Thor based on the Carl G janski very large array data that was combined into this survey that you can also find in the description below and what this survey did was essentially looked for various hydrogen clouds various gas clouds around our galaxy and in order to find certain types of hydrogen they normally do so by looking at what's known as the hydrogen line also known as 21 centimeter line or the frequency that's produced in the atomic hydrogen when the electron here undergoes a spin change and then releases the photon of about 1.4 gigahertz or about a wavelength of 21 centimeters this can be actually seen from everywhere and can even be detected using amateur astronomy tools for example it can actually be detected using a relatively powerful Wi-Fi antenna and it has been done in the past you can actually find really large clouds around the Galaxy but this type of hydrogen is slightly different from what we have here on Earth this is what's referred to as the atomic hydrogen it only contains a proton and an electron this does not actually make planets and stars and so on it doesn't really make anything yet what the planets and stars are usually made out of is referred to as the molecular hydrogen it's the molecule that's made up of two atoms of hydrogen and that's one of the bigger mist there is in the universe how does an atomic hydrogen turn into molecular hydrogen that's required for the production of stars or in other words what causes H1 to then become H2 and it's a really important mystery to solve because as we know today most of the molecular clouds that then end up creating stars and condense into larger and larger chunks of matter all of them contain this and not really as much of this and so it just so happens that Maggie that was recently discovered is essentially the largest filament of atomic hydrogen it's not molecular hydrogen that's usually responsible for forming planets and stars and in case you're wondering Maggie is just a diminutive term for Magdalena or Rio Magdalena the name of the longest river in Colombia lihun country of one of the researchers behind the paper and because this is the longest river and this seems to be the longest hydrogen filament Discovery so far there is obviously some connection and that's the name but for astronomers studying in the evolution of galaxies an evolution of stars this is a big mystery at the moment nobody can actually explain how such a long filament of atomic and not molecular hydrogen could be produced to begin with and also how it got into this location where it is it's not really in the middle of the Galaxy and instead is actually found approximately 1600 light years below the galactic plane which maybe could be explained by some sort of a magnetic field or possibly magnetic lines creating the actual filament and allowing it to exist in this location but at the moment it's really not known mostly because it's also kind of far away to study all of this but it's really because of the location away from the plane that the scientists were able to discover this filament and also for one other important reason so remember we're talking about hydrogen gas that's everywhere if you look at the Galaxy you're going to see it absolutely in every direction so how exactly do you actually tell that there is a structure here that's connected that seems to form one single object well here the scientists did something relatively clever that obviously has been done before 4. they looked at the overall velocity of a certain region of space and try to see if any of the gas there was moving at a relatively similar speed and here you can actually see a lot of the velocity changes are marked in different colors here with everything in color blue showing us the velocity of approximately 54 kilometers per second and so essentially they discovered this one really really long filament that was more or less moving at the same speed possessed relatively similar properties similar temperature and seem to be moving in the same direction around the Galaxy and because of its location underneath the galactic plane and because all of this gas also had similar velocity it sort of stood out from the background of all the other gas present here and to the scientists in this paper the Sony suggested that this was a coherent single structure it was what we usually refer to as the galactic structure with this one being really really long as well but because the main reason for studying these is to really determine how this gas then turns into the molecular gas and starts to create Stars this is a pretty important finding they've already discovered that approximately eight percent of all of the mass here is already molecular hydrogen and has now become the gas that normally produces Stars how that happened is obviously unknown but it's a really important structure to then try to analyze more in order to understand how all this happens in typical galaxies and in general it's actually easier to understand that this is a pre-molecular cloud or basically it's not this yet it's not a cloud that's going to be developing stars but it's sort of like the baby version of this and the scientists realized that at several locations in this filament it already started to sort of coalesce into slightly larger structures or basically at several points it's already creating these large clouds that could potentially become this one day and after this they will start producing stars and new planets also by mass this is approximately 720 000 masses of the Sun so if this ends up producing several molecular clouds it's going to end up producing thousands and thousands of different Stars eventually but at the moment it's also unclear what exactly created this and how any of this works one application here I guess one suggestion is that maybe all of this is somehow controlled by the magnetic field of the Galaxy and once the power of the atom sends basically power of gravity overcomes the magnetic field that's when the filament collapses into various clouds and starts producing stars but the actual process is still purely understood and a lot of scientists are really hoping to learn more about this by studying these objects or very similar objects and thus figuring out how the evolutionary process of star formation Works in typical galaxies how wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be talking about some other pretty incredible discoveries from the center of our own Galaxy from the region known as Sagittarius A star animated in this series of images taken over approximately 20 years with this discovery from just a couple of decades ago eventually resulting in a Nobel Prize but as you probably remember from just a few months ago the scientists from The Event Horizon telescope also recently reviewed the image of the essential black hole that we believe kind of looks like this would this becoming one of the bigger Revolutions of 2022 and we've actually discussed all of the specifics of this image in the video you can find it in description but during the campaign responsible for the production of this particular image and during several months of observations of Sagittarius A star region several other telescopes were also observing trying to discover something else at the same time and for some of these telescopes the data actually took a little bit longer to analyze and they've only recently started to announce exactly what was found in this region on top of the image that was created and so very recently some of the scientists working on the data from the alma Observatory the Atacama large millimeter array released the paper you can find here was something else pretty incredible and discovered in the region something that was previously unseen and took a few months to confirm based on the observations from several other telescopes there seems to be a blob of gas orbiting around the black hole and it was actually identified using several different frequencies and in this case this blob is orbiting away from the black hole at the same distance as planet Mercury from the Sun except that a single orbit here only takes approximately 70 minutes which means that whatever it is it's orbiting around the black hole at practically 30 of the speed of light nearly a hundred thousand kilometers per second but what exactly is it and how exactly was it discovered well first of all sound these initial observations were actually taken for a slightly different reason they were taken because there was an unusual flare of x-rays detected coming from the black hole itself off or at least very close to the black hole and so back then the scientists really wanted to figure out what this was and would produce these unusual emissions or more importantly if it's actually going to happen again and these kinds of flares from various black holes have been already discovered around other objects in the X-ray frequencies but also in the infrared frequencies as well with the explanation being very hot gas bubbles or hot spots that seem to orbit very fast and very close to various black holes although previously these blobs or these hot spots were only visible in the x-rays and the infrared they have never been discovered in any other frequencies up until now and now by using the alma radio telescopes the scientists were able to confirm that they are also visible in the radio light suggesting that these observations these hot spots or these hot blobs are very likely the same phenomenon but produced when the gas that was producing x-rays or the infrared now cooled down become invisible at longer wavelengths or in other words these blobs seem to orbit around black holes and seem to be in different temperatures sometimes they're very hot producing x-rays sometimes they cool down producing just the infrared and sometimes they cool down only producing radio waves with all this very likely been produced as a result of various magnetic interactions as an extremely hot gas orbiting close to the black hole interacts with the magnetic field and then ends up producing all sorts of different emissions as a result and the reason the scientists believe it's magnetic in nature is because of the observations of what's known as polarization polarization or polarized light is essentially a direction of light as it comes toward us normally when the light detected is extremely highly polarized it implies it came from very highly magnetic regions such as the ones we for example detect around various pulsors various neutron stars or other extremely powerful objects with a lot of magnetic lines around them and so in this case the light detected from the black hole and the actual emissions were extremely polarized but the polarization actually changing every 70 minutes or basically the polarization here was rotating at a time scale of just over an hour with the best explanation of course being that this is something that's orbiting around the black hole and depending on the location in its orbit being polarized differently because of the differences in the magnetic field in the vicinity of the black hole and because all of this was also connected to the x-rays here and because these X-rays were also polarized it of course imply that all this was the same event and possibly even the same kind of a blob and at some point this blob became very hot producing X-rays and one of the reasons why it's actually really important to detect the polarization from the light here is because it then allows the scientists to measure the magnetic field around this black hole revealing a lot more details about this region and also helping us understand all of the other properties of Sagittarius A star in other words it helps us uncover the magnetic field of the black hole and the accretion disk at the moment it's not entirely clear exactly what's happening here but the initial of the regions have already revealed several important details for example there are definitive hints that this black hole is spinning and is spinning in the same direction as this particular Block in other words the rotation seems to be in the same way with the accretion disk also spinning in the same direction so all this is moving clockwise as seen from planet Earth and more intriguingly it also allows us to understand the plane of motion of this object and possibly the accretion disk as well in this case it appears that we're looking at the accretion disk and of course this blob of matter orbiting around it almost exactly face on would very likely only about 20 degrees inclination and this is based on observations from Alma and also another project known as gravity which implies that some of the matter around the disk his orbiting in a way that you see right here but naturally what produces these hot spots or how these unusual blobs of matter are formed is not currently known to us we only know that it's magnetic in nature but exactly why they form is unknown and these phenomena don't even have a good name yet but now the scientists are really hoping to see these particular objects using new observations from The Event Horizon telescopes once again because this is the most powerful radio telescope we have right now it might be able to reveal something else that was missed the first time and naturally help us understand a little bit more about black holes and the environment around them for example not so long ago I've discussed this new proposition from some of the scientists that suggests that if black holes are quantum in nature they might actually have these unusual vortex-like formations on the surface which could be responsible for some of these magnetic lines and so if all this stem connects to these blobs the scientists might actually find evidence for all this and thus resolve the nature of black holes by resolving the nature of this unusual phenomena although as of right now all of this is still a huge mystery it's a very exciting Discovery that's definitely a very mysterious Discovery but the true nature of any of this is completely unknown to us hello wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing the center of our own Galaxy once again but not the black hole we're going to be discussing something or many things that orbit around the black hole and more specifically if we were to move toward this area which actually takes just under 30 000 light years to reach we would sort of discover an area that resembles something like this containing quite a lot of different stars and star-like objects and containing quite a lot of activity and a lot of motion now this is sort of the simulation here but we do have actual images from this area as well something that was created over a period of at least 20 years and it's actually because of these images and because of the motion of these Stars the scientists were able to definitively say that there is something really massive and something really dense in the middle something that's very likely a black hole which eventually resulted in this the scientific collaboration of the Event Horizon telescope that created this beautiful image that we have of the central black hole oops talking about the black hole again anyway let's talk about the Stars orbiting it so the central region contains quite a lot of stars in orbit around the black hole and most of them are currently known as the S stars with the actual list being pretty long and most of these stars are entirely different from one another but they do basically share one thing in common the rule gravitational attached to the black hole itself and it also seemed to interact with one another at least to some extent now the most studied and the most well known on these stars is the star known as S2 it's also the star that's basically allowed the scientists to study a lot of different gravitational effects and prove a lot of einsteinian theories as a matter of fact back in 2018 this star had its closest approach to the black hole once again and allowed the scientists to see the red shifting effects that were essentially the result of of higher gravity in this region now this image right here is just in illustration it's not actually what it looked like but the scientists did detect red shifting effects in the Spectrum coming from the Star as they approached the center and when it comes to these Stars it's so important to understand a little bit more about the orbital Dynamics when it comes to objects orbiting other objects in this case an object with higher eccentricity like the object that you see in pink or I guess that's maroon color will have much higher velocity when it approaches the star or the black hole in this case and this region right here that we usually refer to as a periapsis whereas the object orbiting in a circular orbit like the red object will always have constant velocity around the central area and so the scientists in this case are always on a lookout for new stars that seem to approach the black hole at their closest specifically here we're talking about stars that would be super super close to the center and that's because these Stars will be zooming around the black hole at ridiculously high the war series they would actually be the fastest stars in our galaxy and it just so happens that very recently there was an article that I seem to have seen in many different places that claimed to have discovered the new fastest star in the galaxy based on this very recent paper that you can find in the description below of the star known as s-4716 a completely newly discovered object that's also orbiting somewhere in this region and being such an exciting object it already seems to have its own Wikipedia page although relatively short one where it is claimed that this is the fastest star known to us reaching the velocity of approximately 8 000 kilometers per second as it approaches the closest part of the orbit the one that I showed you here known as periapsis the thing is that's not entirely correct it is an exciting object and it is an exciting star but it's far from being the fastest as of today the fastest star discovered is still the one that was discovered and talked about on this channel two years ago back in 2020 so let's maybe clarify some details and a few more things about this object and also talk about some really exciting discoveries coming from this paper so first the star itself according to the scientists it seems to be approximately four times the mass of our sun representing what we usually refer to as a b type star with an average temperature of about 12 000 degrees 12 000 Kelvin that is and what makes this star unique and quite exciting is the fact that it has the fastest orbit around the black hole it only takes roughly around 4 years to orbit once as a matter of fact you can kind of see that in this case its orbit is so tight compared to some of the other stars but it's actually almost impossible to even see it as its surf is blocked by a lot of other stars in the area the biggest culprit in this case is that S2 Star as 2 in this case is so bright and moves quite fast as well that it actually ends up covering some of this area and makes detection of other stars quite difficult nevertheless by using the total of five different telescopes observing this region which is exactly what you're seeing right here these are the actual images the scientists were able to discover this new star and also confirm some of the other stars as well with the star s4716 coming extremely close to the black hole roughly around 100 astronomical units away from the center that's almost three times as far away as Pluto but is actually closer to us than the current position of the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 and at this distance it moves at a speed of about 8 000 kilometers per second and that's of course because the black hole in the middle is really massive with this most recent calculation suggesting that the masses at least 4 million masses of the Sun a little bit closer to 4.1 but not 4.3 as previously claimed while at the same time the scientists were also even able to calculate the total mass of stuff orbiting around the black hole and so here we're talking about both the accretion disk and a lot of other dust and a lot of other star-like and planet-like stuff that's essentially accumulated in this region they discovered that there's at least 20 000 masses of the Sun in the region of this black hole that seems to sort of change the orbits of certain objects that come a little bit too close so in some sense you can think of it as the equation disk and in this case they were also able to determine a relatively accurate distance measurement to the black hole establishing that it's about 26.2 000 light years away from planet Earth while also discovering that some of these previous observations of other stars might actually have been confused with one another because some of these stars are a little bit too bright and cover the smaller objects with a relatively bright and really fast star known as s62 that manages to reach the velocity of about 20 000 kilometers per second at its closest also being really bright and moving fast enough that sometimes it's confused for other stars which means that the current list of s stars in this region may need to be reanalyzed by some of the future studies suggesting that some of these Stars might not exist because they were just another star that seemed to have been in the location that some of the studies might have misinterpreted as a completely new object or because of the shortness of the orbit of s4716 on average it does actually have the fastest velocity around the black hole so at its closest it approaches the black OS approximately 98 astronomical units but at its farthest it only goes to about 702 astronomical units and so in theory at least it essentially has the fastest orbit around black hole of all of the stars discovered so far with its orbital period looking something like this but as I mentioned this is not the fastest star that record belongs to another really interesting star that approaches the black hole at a distance of just 12.6 astronomical units away from the center almost as close as Planet siren to the Sun and that's a star known as s-4714 we've talked about this object on the channel previously and you can learn more about this in one of the links in the description and in this case at its closest the speed of the star is approximately 24 000 kilometers per second roughly around 8 percent of the speed of light and that makes it at least three times faster than the recently identified and recently discovered star which also means that the record holder here is still the star known as s4714 and it's very unlikely that its record is going to be beat anytime soon the solar paper describes this discovery in a little bit more detail but it's already period is 12 years so the only reason it has such a high velocity close to the black hole is because of the eccentricity once again or in other words its orbit is a lot more oval in shape the eccentricity here is about 98.7 percent and so at its closest the speed becomes ridiculously fast but a lot of these as stars move really fast at their closest orbit actually only very few of them move with a speed of less than 1 000 kilometers per second at the closest approach so all of them have very fast velocities and you can actually check out this table that you can find in the description below that shows you some of the other parameters of all of these stars in this case if we actually sort all of these Stars by speed you can kind of see which ones are the fastest and S2 is pretty fast compared to all of these objects although not only this is currently formalized and none of these names are even permanent and so some of these properties and some of the names as well might change in the future this is still a pretty new area of study and in this case the scientists still don't really know much about the stars or how all of this interacts with the central black hole over time but when it comes to s4716 one of the most surprising discoveries is actually how stable the orbit is considering the total distance to the supermassive black hole at the moment the Sanchez are not entirely certain how it's able to have such a stable and somewhat permanent orbit in this vicinity and more specifically they're really not certainly how it even got here how did the star drop its orbit so much that it approached the black hole without essentially being destroyed or without disappearing somewhere else and so that's one of the Mysteries the scientists are trying to solve at the moment they think it's actually because of the total mass orbits in the black hole that eventually sort of interacted with the star and lowered its orbit over time but at the moment nobody really knows it is however quite unlikely that a star like this would form in this region by itself so it must have migrated here during its existence in the central region from somewhere entirely different nevertheless it's a pretty exciting Discovery because now by knowing its orbit and by being able to actually look at the star the scientists can start analyzing the vicinity of the black hole even more and possibly just cover some other unusual objects we didn't really know existed in this area they can also use the minute deviations of the orbit of the star to discover any unusual gravitational anomalies that might be present in the area either for example due to the accretion disk or possibly some other invisible objects possibly even under black holes orbiting around the central Sagittarius A star hello wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing a discovery of an extremely rare planetary nebula any type of an object that you kind of see behind me although in this case once again the name itself doesn't really apply very well to these objects they have nothing to do with planets and in reality represent a type of a nebula produced by stars extremely similar to our own sun right after these stars go through their red giant period or as they're about to turn into a white dwarf with this probably now being one of the more popular images of this phenomena because this was one of the images released by the James Webb and because these nebula often form extremely beautiful formations in the night skies they've also been extremely popular with various amateur astronomers although some of them are somewhat difficult to see because of their distances but what's really intriguing about many of these objects is how extremely unique they are and how they're actually able to produce so many different shapes and will always have have a very unique features inside of them for example this one right here is known as the lemon slice nebula ic3568 and it kind of does resemble a lemon slice with a lot of them also forming the unusual bipolar shapes often extending in both directions and this is usually because these objects are created by some kind of a binary system on the inside where a smaller star and a red giant interact throwing off a hold of the gas in two directions because of the Jets from one of the objects and in this case as you can see from this simulation they kind of end up forming this unusual structure that then becomes visible from extremely far away a lot of these objects are at least a few light years across but in this video we're going to be discussing a very recent discovery of what seems to be the oldest potentially the biggest and also one of the strangest planetary nebula discovered to date found inside this open cluster known as messian 37 a cluster that seems to contain at least 500 known stars and potentially has a total mass of about 1500 solar masses with the overall age of all the stars here being around half a billion years old with at least a few of the stars in this region already been in the red giant stage or essentially being in that stage right before they turn into planetary nebula when they essentially start bubbling up and throw off a huge amount of gas from the outer shell and that's exactly what happened to one of these Stars approximately 70 000 years ago a star that ended up producing the object that you see right here now it is kind of difficult to see it and that's because the distance here is about 4 500 light years away from us but even at this distance this emission nebula contains the telltale signs of ionized gas ejected from an ancient red giant something that the scientists in this case were kind of surprised to discover first of all because this is actually an extremely rare object because of its location this is only the third known planetary nebulance discovered inside any kind of a cluster but in this case because it's inside this open cluster it actually allows this object to stay relatively undisturbed by anything else and specifically allows this nebula to expand even larger normally if it was located anywhere else in outer space The Intergalactic gas would have Disturbed it so much that it would probably be invisible by now but by being inside the cluster that shelters it from a lot of interruptions it was able to expand much farther and more intriguingly was able to become much older than any other planetary nebula we've ever seen now normally a typical star such as our sun is going to go through the stage relatively quickly anywhere from about 5 to maybe 25 000 years after which point all of the gas from the Star dissipates across the Galaxy and basically goes on its near way most likely ended up in some other object in the future but the nebula itself becomes more or less invisible prior to this some of the oldest nebula were only about 25 000 years old and even at this point this is really pushing their limit but this unusual object is much older it's at least 70 000 years old according to the scientists and they were essentially able to calculate its age by looking at the speed of the dispersion of material and then looking at the total side of this object in terms of the total size it's just over 10 light years across one of the biggest if not the biggest ever seen and assuming that it was expanding at constant velocity it must have started doing so approximately 70 000 years ago which is essentially when the original Star ended its red giant stage and started to turn into a white dwarf which is of course the future of our own Sun as well although here we're talking about like seven to eight billion years in the future you can actually learn a little bit more about this in one of the videos in the description below but by approximating the total mass of the expanded shell and also realizing that many stars in this cluster are no older than 500 million years old the scientists came to a conclusion that they started essentially we created this must have been approximately 2.8 solar masses so definitely more massive than our own sun and very likely a lot more active a star that survived for 500 million years before becoming a red giant and before it created this beautiful planetary nebula but the other thing that makes this particular Discovery kind of interesting is the location in the Galaxy unlike a lot of other nebula and a lot of other clusters this is actually sort of on the outskirts of the Milky Way or essentially it's in the opposite direction from the center of our own Galaxy if you were to look at it from planet Earth you would first of all have to turn around completely in order to discover this cluster and the nebula this is the location we often refer to as the galactic anti-center and moreover it seems to be located right at the tip of one of the nearby Galactic arms and because of its location it's one of the brightest and one of the easier visible clusters seen from planet Earth meaning that studying this particular nebula or discovering more unusual features inside this cluster is going to be so much easier for a lot of future studies and a lot of future observations although at the moment we only have this image right here not really that good yet to be able to produce any detailed observations or any detailed analysis but because this nebula play a very important role in the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and they actually tend to produce a lot of important elements inside of them as well the discovery of this really old planetary nebula is going to be exceptionally important for the scientists studying the evolution of galaxies and because even after 70 000 years it's still visible in a lot of different frequencies of light it's quite likely that it's going to serve as a very important investigation Target for a lot of astronomers in the future but this is also an extremely rare object not only is it so big and so old it's also one of the few spherical nebula without any major protrusions or binary features the vast majority of nebula discovered will often have something sticking out somewhere this one doesn't and so finding these spherically symmetrical objects especially once not so far away from us is already quite a big achievement especially because it's only recently that the scientists started to figure out how some of these unusual features are formed in these nebula for example in this case a slight warp inside the disk of the star might produce certain features that eventually produce something like this and So eventually through various computer simulations it's quite possible that the scientists are going to be able to work out what this particular star system looked like in the past by basically tracing back the shape of the star system through the shapes and the deformations seen in the planetary nebula it's not something we can do just yet but it's something that a lot of scientists are definitely interested in discovering in the last few years the scientists have made some really incredible discoveries about our own galaxy The Milky Way discoveries that really redefined our understanding of what our galaxy looks like and so even though we kind of assume that the Galaxy might resemble something like this the reality is a lot more complicated first of all it seems to be kind of warped it also has all of these unusual streams around it it has a very large Halo that's also slanted as well and possesses a lot of other features such as Global clusters present all over the place but all this discussed in some of the previous videos you can find in the description but more neural features become apparent if you start observing the Galaxy in other frequencies for example radio frequencies infrared light or even X-ray and gamma ray light but obviously our eyes cannot see which obviously transforms the Galaxy even more so here's the visible light here are some of the older observations in the x-rays the gamma rays the infrared light microwave light and of course radio light as well but but these observations are on a slightly older side a lot of newer observations start to discover some really incredible features that even today we have trouble explaining and today we're going to be discussing one of these features unusual string like formations or unusual filaments that seem to be present in the Milky Way itself but also seem to be present outside of the Galaxy and obviously in other galaxies as seen by various other telescopes and here we're talking about these very strange filaments we discussed in one of the previous videos once again in the description below that kind of become apparent if you look at the Galaxy by observing it in radio frequencies filaments that stretch for at least several light years and that seem to propagate throughout the Galaxy and seem to be located in a lot of different regions although predominantly they seem to be associated with a lot of ancient Supernova or regions with a lot of molecular gas that might possess quite a lot of magnetic energy which the scientists believe creates this unusual phenomena and so in some sense these are believed to be magnetic element potentially related to a much smaller phenomenon of solar filaments we observe on the surface of the Sun that is magnetic in nature but also obviously may be formed in some entirely different way we still don't understand and intriguingly the scientists behind this recent paper have actually originally discovered the first filament back in the 1980s pretty much four decades ago only a small one was seen at first but more and more started to be discovered as our telescopes became better and today over a thousand filaments have already been discovered all across the Milky Way galaxy with some of them stretching all the way up to 150 light years in length with some of the longest ones being located very close to the center of the Galaxy but the recent paper focused on something slightly different discovering similar filaments in other galaxies such as this distant radio Galaxy that has so much similar filaments formed by the massive black hole in the Middle with several other similar filaments discovered in some other galaxies but intriguingly all of them being dramatically longer than anything in the Milky Way for example this one right here is over 300 light years in length several times longer than a typical filament in the Milky Way galaxy and although many of them do seem to resemble the ones we've discovered in the Milky Way as well such as the one on the right in terms of the sheer size they're just dramatically larger as you can see the one on the left is approximately 3 000 times longer even though it possesses a relatively similar shape here is another comparable image between the Milky Way on the bottom an object referred to as feather and another object 25 000 times larger located in a distant Galaxy but with somewhat similar features but in most cases a lot of these observations came from very active very massive radio galaxies with really powerful black holes in the center although because of the similarity in structure it might actually appear as if it was created by a relatively similar type of phenomenon and so the underlying physical mechanism could be generally the same but unlike the filament in the Milky Way galaxy are only visible because first of all they're much larger but they also seem to be much much older they likely existed for millions or even billions of years although a lot of newly discovered filaments mostly seem to be part of a large Galactic cluster that contains thousands of different galaxies interacting with one another approximately 1 billion light years away from planet Earth but it's the radio galaxies within the cluster that seem to be forming a lot of these filaments although despite being very likely more powerful and much larger their overall magnetic field is much weaker as well at least one thousand times weaker than what we actually observe here in the Milky Way and also unlike the variety of filaments in the Milky Way galaxy the majority of extra Galactic filaments seem to be mostly at 90 degree angle from the black hole jets that usually look something like this which means that they create a kind of an unusual shape that's I think better visible right here and this particular feature is obviously kind of difficult to explain right now but because the overall shape is very similar to what we've seen in Milky Way and because even the length to width ratio is exactly the same the overall mechanism responsible for their production is believed to be the same as well or at least extremely similar for example as seen in this filament it seems to possess more energy closer to its origin and in this case it's closer to the jet from the black hole but starts to lose energy as it travels farther down eventually disappearing into nothingness and in both cases it's not entirely clear where all this originates for example for the radio Galaxy it's assumed that the jet provides the initial energy with the filament then moving on its own path and losing the energy in the process but what exactly makes these filaments so long and allows them to accelerate for such a long distance is still not entirely clear I mean for example here you're looking at something that's over 150 000 of light years in length that's basically the size of our own Galaxy more intriguing this seems to be formed by y electrons traveling along the magnetic lines and because they don't travel at the speed of light it means that for some of these objects these electrons travel 400 or even 500 000 years before they finally disappear in some cases this can be up to a million years and what exactly allows them to travel for so long without breaking apart is of course unknown now one potential explanation here is well maybe all this comes from the motion of the Galaxy itself as the Galaxy rotates it might create a comet like tail behind it essentially forming these are neurofilaments the interaction between the motion of the galactic Edge and the stuff between galaxies maybe create some of these filaments in the process or the other explanation could be related to some kind of a turbulence inside a relatively weak magnetic field as various galaxies inside the cluster move around the resulting interaction can start creating various vertices and a lot of motion on the inside and as the weak magnetic field starts to wrap around on these disturbances it can get stretched folded and Amplified with time resulting in the variety of different filament-like structures with relatively strong magnetic field inside of them at least that's one of the two explanations the scientists proposed right now although the reality is that we still actually have no idea how many of these are formed and more realistically we actually have no idea if the ones inside the Milky Way despite their similarity have anything in common with the ones outside of the Milky Way or if these are actually completely different phenomena despite their similarity in shape now it's most likely that these are magnetic in nature and very likely are the result of something extremely powerful such as a supernova producing these over time but there's also a chance that many of these are created by different events that actually result in similar observations and so in other words even after years and years of research we found so many over a thousand now yet the actual origin is still a little bit mysterious one of the major discoveries from our own galaxy The Milky Way in the last few years was actually the discovery of the unusual formations above and below the Galaxy we normally refer to as the Fermi bubbles named after the telescope the gamma-ray telescope that originally discovered them roughly around 12 years ago and these particular formations at first did not really have much reason to be there until we realized they were most likely formed by a major expulsion from the center of the Galaxy from the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A star but even after years and years of Investigation there are still new Mysteries being discovered about these bubbles with some of them discussed in one of the videos you can find in the description below but today we're going to be discussing another Discovery a discovery that might actually solved one of the mysteries about these formations or actually a mystery within the mystery if you were to look at the structure in more detail you would actually start discovering some other features with that that are difficult to explain there's one right here known as the Cocoon and the reason this cocoon is so mysterious is really because it seems to be much brighter than a lot of other spots this particular region seems to produce more radiation more powerful radiation and seems to contain a lot of accelerated cosmic rays coming from this Southern lobe and all this was actually discovered approximately 11 years ago in 2011. you can find the PDF that describes some of these discoveries in the description below and so this cocoon was always also kind of mysterious why is it that this particular region seems to have more of everything in it if this was a bipolar Mission from our black hole shouldn't it be more or less equally distributed if there was more emissions and more radiation and more mass on one side what's the actual reason for it now naturally this is just one of many mysteries about the ferment Bubbles and one of many size structures but it looks like this particular mystery has now been solved and specifically sold by the Australian scientists whose paper you can find in the description below with the results from this paper providing very definitive Solutions but also providing an extremely logical explanation so first of all when starting the Cocoon or studying this particular region the scientists realized that there's actually something else and very close to it that was also discovered only a few years ago slightly easier to see it in this image but one of the major satellites of the Milky Way galaxy known as Sagittarius dwarf steroidal galaxy has its core right here okay it's actually not really that easily visible but we know that this right here M54 or a massive 54 Global cluster also very likely represents its core but the rest of the Galaxy is not particularly easily visible and there's a really important reason for that over the period of several billion years as it orbited around the Milky Way it was actually tidally disrupted spaghettified turned into an extremely long stream and more or less absorbed otherwise these are known as the Stellar strings and the scientists have already discovered quite a few of them and all of them are a result of ancient collusions or ancient absorptions of various galaxies that orbited the Milky Way that's how Galaxy grew so big and the main core of this galaxy along with its Center M54 is actually right here in this region which just so happens to be very coincident with the location of the Cocoon from the ferment bubbles okay but this could be just a coincidence however there's at least one more piece of evidence as this image from the study illustrates both the Cocoon and the Sagittarius dwarf Galaxy Core also seem to have very similar shape but more importantly very similar orientation and that by itself is already very difficult to reproduce by accident so we have orientation we have the shape and we have the location unfortunately the distance here is very difficult to determine mostly because that's how things are in space we can't really measure the redshift here and we don't really have any other objects to compare this to so distance wise we don't really know where this is but three pieces of evidence is enough to kind of assume that maybe yes maybe this is exactly what produces the Cocoon and so the higher concentration of gamma rays that seem to be coming from the Fermi bubbles in reality seem to be actually coming from the core of Sagittarius dwarf but because of our position in the galaxy actually it appears as if it's coming from the forming bubbles even though it's really behind them and in order to make their point even more scientific the scientists decided to create several emission models with various explanations in those models including the model where the Cocoon was part of the Fermi bubbles but only one of these simulations only one of the models were producing what we're observing if the emissions were coming from the Sagittarius dwarf as shown in this image right here we would get exactly the same gamma ray of Divisions as we were actually seeing in real life with all the other models just not really being as convincing and naturally because these are some of the brightest and the most powerful gamma rays produced in our galaxy this has always kind of blocked the scientists they wanted to know what exactly is producing this looks like now they kind of know the brightest and the highest energy gamma ray radiation is not actually coming from the Milky disk it's coming from the leftover Sagittarius dwarf Galaxy but that's just part of the answer still what exactly is actually producing it though what's causing this gamma rays even if it's coming from Sagittarius dwarf Well normally in our own galaxy The Milky Way most of the gamma rays are produced by the collusion between cosmic rays and various types of interstellar gas it sort of kind of looks like this you have the photon and the electron and as one strikes the other gamma rays are produced and all this is then seen in various gamma-ray emissions coming from the Fermi Bubbles and these cosmic rays generally come from very distant objects usually very powerful supermassive black holes in distant galaxies but that gas came from the supermassive black hole in the middle of our own Galaxy for a Sagittarius dwarf though this exponition doesn't really work mostly because we know that this is a much much smaller satellite Galaxy and we know that for the most part it seems to have been already stripped of all of its gas very likely two to three billion years ago and most of this gas is still kind of visible as the long string that stretches around the Milky Way and so since there is probably no Interstellar gas here to be interacting with the cosmic rays this cannot really be the explanation and the other explanation for VR powerful emissions could be a word of supernova like huge amounts of supernova but at the moment it's kind of difficult to explain why there will be so many Supernova in this region and no other signs of these have been detected so far and that kind of leaves us with maybe just one possible explanation and that's actually a very similar explanation to how scientists try to explain the excess galleries in the middle of the Milky Way this region might actually contain quite a lot of very powerful pulsars or essentially very powerful neutron stars and specifically newly second pulsers that are spinning extremely fast and as they spin they made a lot of radiation and soundness radiation includes a lot of powerful gamma rays but pulsors generally do not live very long so there has to be a reason why they were suddenly created and in this case there is actually an explanation for that as well their existence can be explained by the most recent formation period in this part civil Galaxy as it interacted with the Milky Way and today it's actually believed that as Sagittarius dwarf Galaxy orbited around the Milky Way and as it passed through its disk both galaxies experience severely dramatic star formation periods which happened at least twice and we actually discussed some of these discoveries in one of the older videos you can find in the description and so if there are actual signs of star formation in the Milky Way we expect these signs to be in the other Galaxy as well but naturally there is still something that we cannot explain why exactly is it so bright why is it so powerful these emissions seem to be much brighter than the ones in the Milky Way galaxy and even brighter than the ones in the nearby Andromeda galaxy although the scientists do provide at least one possible explanation if these posers are relatively old maybe 7 billion years old and if they also have relatively low metal content there is maybe a chance that they will be producing so many gamma rays but this also means that we should be seeing very similar observations in other dwarf Galaxies for example in the nearby large and small module it clouds at the moment it doesn't really seem that way so either something is really unusual about this particular Galaxy or the other explanation could maybe involve the mysterious Dark Matter some of the Dark Matter scientists have all proposed that dark matter particles should also be producing excess gamma-ray observations and so there's actually a chance that these gamma-ray emissions could maybe produce by the Dark Matter inside Sagittarius dwarf which already implies that the discoveries from the study are going to be discussed and analyzed for many years to come it's either going to help us understand how galaxies evolve or it's going to help us understand what exactly dark matter is and how exactly it acts in various galaxies or possibly provide a lot more answers that we can even imagine either way super important Discovery very important paper and definitely an intriguing explanation to an old mystery which also means that we're going to be coming back and talking more about these Galactic interactions and Galactic collisions and how the influence our galaxy and what effects they produce on the Galaxy in some of the future videos as well but you should also probably check out some of the previous videos that should be in the

1UF8Q8s8T_0,15:21,en,true,true,ok,,"and just to see what kind of damage some of these asteroids could do to us let's go back to the simulation where we have all of the named asteroids flying around the Sun we're going to pause the game remove the sun place the Earth in the middle right there we're going to zoom into Earth and go into this part right here where is it Powers I think and basically um stop all of the roids in their space wherever they're flying they're going to stop right now and head toward our planet so there's going to be a little bit of Destruction here get ready for that well here comes the Swarm I'm going to slow down a time so it's actually a little bit more realistic and also they don't actually end up bugging out and flying out in the other space let's see what happens here comes the first few a Agy is one of the first few then we have who's this guy SA or saitta and here they come oh and by the way our Earth has been completely Frozen because there's no sun now so it's now an a snowball completely Frozen snowball that's so beautiful look at that and if we stand on the surface and look into the sky look at that we see all of these names names of our Doom coming toward us so much closer and closer all right so here comes the first few let's see oh there and their speed is actually 6 km per second let's see what happens and it looks like the first two hitters is going to be aathy an asteroid that's about 4.5 kilm in size so it's about half the size of the asteroid that killed the dinosaur so possibly even less than that and its total mass is very very large it uh it's 1 time 10 to uh to the power of 15 and it's moving at a velocity of about 6.5 km/s so this is going to be the first asteroid to hit us uh let's see what happens it's coming really close oh actually wait a second he might even miss haha he might even miss I think it might actually not even yes look at that it we got lucky everyone we got lucky the first asteroid totally missed us excellent all right so we're still good and the reason why it missed us is because um it was interacting gravitationally of course with other asteroids so its um its path toward Earth has been kind of diverted by other asteroids and this is what really happens in the asteroid field as well because the smaller asteroids they interact with each other and they do shift each other's orbits all the time so one of them might come close to Earth and one of them might end up not hitting Earth even though it was originally supposed to hit Earth just like uh it happened now so Agate escaped into the otheros solar system and will probably never come back to us and here comes the next asteroid Sai and it looks like it's going to miss us as well its trajectory is uh few thousand km away from Earth so we're kind of safe again uh getting really lucky what about this one look ccia oh okay so this one looks like might actually hit us let's zoom into it it's 5.7 km in radius and it's about uh twice the mass of the first asteroid that missed us moving at approximately the same speed so let's see if lucrecia actually hits us okay and here comes lucrecia it's approaching Earth but look at that looks like we're lucky again it's passing by very close but not necessarily close enough to hit it and and Earth gets lucky again the third asteroid passes by safely within only uh I think this is about maybe about 10,000 kilom away from our actual uh surface so we got lucky again and now that I'm actually looking at other asteroids a lot of them will actually be missing us a lot of them have interacted with each other enough to uh to completely misalign their or each other's trajectory so lot of them will actually pass by very close but not many of them if any actually will hit us uh this is actually the one that's coming close to us uh graia and it's still not going to hit us oh wait a second constancia looks like Constantia might hit us after all it's actually centered right in the middle of our um of our planet and the name of our Doom was Constantia looks like this is one of the asteroids and this is actually number 11 on the approach to earth that is about to hit us straight in the face now this is 13 km exactly or very close to the size of the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs where we go here we go and it smacks right there and where is this I can't even tell what continent this is anymore I believe this is somewhere close to Australia and leaves this really really huge uh explosion Mark but nothing else I I don't think our planet is is going to warm up from this so might as well keep going because uh it might create a little bit of disturbances here and there but because we're already live on the snowball it will not do anything to us Constantia you just kind of created a little hole in our ice cover but that's that's all we did but this asteroid was about the same size as the asteroid that 65 million years ago uh smacked into Yucatan near Mexico and or in Mexico and uh eventually caused the Extinction of dinosaurs the dinosaurs were replaced by mammals and some of them turned into birds so birds are the closest relatives to dinosaurs that we have today and number two winner is Flora 65 km in radius uh asteroid that is about a 100 times heavier than the guy before it and look at that it's going to smack right here and hopefully cause some serious damage but you know what that's probably not a good thing thing to say uh let's watch what happens whoa look at that this is awesome this is what I wanted I wanted to have a big explosion so this was a 65 kilometer um asteroid that would probably kill everything on the planet and cause some serious serious destruction and unfortunately when I looked at the trajectory of Vesta and series and all the big guys they were actually missing our planet so they wouldn't even make it to us uh I decided to actually hold all velocities with this button right here and have them reset their velocities because what I realized one of the reasons why they miss is because not only do the asteroids are attracted to us but Earth is actually attracted to them so we currently even have a bit of a speed so by the time that some of them get to the location where they were attracted to Earth has already moved so that's why a lot of them actually missed us now I tried to reset and see if I can actually have at least Vesta hit me and looks like Vesta is slowly approaching us so let's see if it actually happens because I would like to see what happens if those major big bodies come for a visit as well and here comes Vesta finally I actually had to wait for 30 years for it to get to Earth and it's moving at about 2 km per second because I did kind of reset velocities but nevertheless we will finally see a very big Collision of a really big asteroid and Vesta as I've mentioned in previous video is not a dwarf planet this is an asteroid and it's going to make a big boo boom on our on the surface of our planet here we go okay and the boom was not as big as I thought it would be and this was actually a very small boom anyway um a lot of the other asteroids either missed or hid the Earth and uh we're going to wait for all the big ones to get here there's still psyche series and a few other ones once they combine with Earth we're going to look at the total mass of Earth and I'm going to show you something and four more to go here comes Palace and it is an asteroid it's about 200 63 km in size uh it's not too big not too small but it will definitely cause some serious damage on the planet and it's uh it's going to make a quite an interesting uh spectacle when it lands and here it comes and you can kind of see how tiny it is in comparison to Earth but nevertheless if this had landed on our planet uh right now we would probably all be dead because it is a very very large asteroid that can cause serious damage look at that it instantly warmed up our planet we now have oceans because of the explosion it suddenly made temperature okay now we're back to ice interesting interesting effects we have here but anyway so you'll see fragments Landing as well it's going to be quite a spectacular uh event and look at all the fragments landing and warming up the rest of the planet and although this did create quite a fireball on our planet uh the temperature is actually still very very cold if we were to go into climate it's -6Â° C average which is way colder than the original temperature of 15Â° C so even though we may have lost half the planet there's quite a lot of uh really nice locations here where you can kind of survive still because it's not very cold although in real life the actual um explosion would have created ridiculously high tsunamis and earthquakes that would most likely destroy everything now that the fire has subsided you can see the remains of the damage here so Australia is all covered in holes and looks like the ocean here has gone completely as well it evaporated uh so that's really the effect that you get from such a huge collision and the next is psyche it's an asteroid that's about half the size of Palace and let's see what it actually does to our planet when it lands we can see that the planet has recovered it became the ice ball again even though there's huge craters on it now but let's see what what this guy does and boom all right well not as as spectacular as Palace but nevertheless it left quite a large crater as well and some of the fragments did warm up the planet a little bit so the temperature now is minus 51 degrees C it's still dropping but we still don't really know what's going to happen when series gets here because series is the largest object in the asteroid belt and it is a dwarf planet and before series get here we still have hiia which is almost 200 kilm in radius it's slightly uh smaller than Vesta but slightly bigger than Palace and it's going to be landing somewhere right here possibly in the in the Creator that we already have and hopefully causing quite a lot of damage as well and here it comes and you can see how tiny these are in comparison to our planet this is a ridiculously small object but nevertheless will cause serious damage here we go look at that beauty okay so no fragments so that's or maybe some fragments actually all right so looks like um Hy didn't really do as much damage uh but the fragments are still falling so let's see what happens but we still have series series is the last on the list it's coming from this side right here and it's going to make quite an explosion and what's really funny is that because of all these collisions Earth's uh trajectory has actually shifted and so s is actually going to miss it again uh but if I hold its velocity there we go it's going to reset its trajectory and now it's going to definitely hit Earth uh but not going as fast as it was originally though which is fine it's still going to uh cause quite a lot of damage Because by the time it gets closer to Earth its velocity is going to be at least 2 km/ second and while we're waiting for sarus to get to earth look at that so Earth's speed is also increasing and this is because of sirus's pool on Earth because there's actually no other bodies left here there's only Series in Earth now and it's slowly accelerating towards series basically it's uh receiving a little bit of gravitational pull from from series while um Earth is also pulling series toward us so this is essentially uh both bodies acting on each other and pulling each other closer together and here comes the big moment so this is series actually this is a very very realistic picture of series because we did have a satellite that orbited for quite some time this is I mentioned this in one of the previous videos uh there's a mission that visited both series and Vesta and we've taken some really really specific pictures of its surface and so let's see what it does to our already battered earth look at all the crators it has it actually kind of looks more like moon now than it uh than it does like Earth and just to for a comparison look at how tiny series is in comparison to our beautiful but damaged Planet uh so here here is the size comparison it's really it's kind of like a a size of a p compared to like I don't know an uh a very large basketball or something and look at that look at all of those fragments and all of this destruction and our Earth still too cold actually it's still uh below the original temperature so even the collision with series didn't really change much in terms of uh overall temperature now obviously melted the ice and it kind of did create a huge Creator and possibly huge tsunamis huge explosions earthquakes and so on and everyone's definitely dead by now but um it didn't really change our planet that much so if there's um any kind of extrem files or any kind of life that usually thrives in extreme conditions it would definitely survive so it would still not be the end of life on Earth because uh we still have continents we still have water and we still have Organics which means that the life will prevail and very likely evolve now what I wanted to show you is this look at that the mass of Earth even when I collided it with almost every asteroid in the asteroid belt has not changed yes it has changed but it hasn't changed dramatically it hasn't even increased by 1% in other words all those asteroids if you combine them they're not even 1% of total mass of Earth that's how insignificant they are in comparison to our planet anyway so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I kind of tried to explain everything about the asteroids create um a somewhat realistic asteroid belt in Universe sunbox 2 and also show you what happens if you combine all of the asteroids from the asteroid field with our planet and this is what happens to our planet after it has an encounter with all of those asteroids we get lots of lots of lots of different creators everywhere and this is it this is kind of game over for Humanity anyway thank you so much for watching hopefully you enjoy this video and if you did leave a like comment and subscribe also check out some of the other Universe sunbox 2 videos and game you later guys bye-bye"
3nnkoAbaHZs,8:29,pt-BR,false,true,ok,,"Todo ser vivo precisa lutar contra outrosÂ  seres vivos que querem se alimentar dele. Conforme a vida multicelular evoluiu ao longo deÂ  bilhÃµes de anos, encontrou formas de se defender. Hoje, os humanos tÃªm uma sofisticadaÂ  rede de defesa, como barreiras fÃ­sicas, cÃ©lulas de defesa e fÃ¡bricas de armas. Mas uma das defesas mais importantes do nosso corpo Ã© amplamente desconhecida: O sistema complemento. Ele evoluiu hÃ¡ mais de 700 milhÃµes de anosÂ  e Ã© um exÃ©rcito de mais de 30 proteÃ­nas diferentes que trabalham juntas numa danÃ§aÂ  complexa e elegante contra os intrusos. Ao todo, cerca de 15 quintilhÃµes delas estÃ£oÂ  saturando todos os fluidos do seu corpo agora. Guiadas apenas pela quÃ­mica, essasÂ  proteÃ­nas sÃ£o uma das armas mais eficazes que temos contra os invasores. VÃ¡rias partes do sistema imunolÃ³gico sÃ£o sÃ³ meios de ativar o sistema complemento. Mas ele tambÃ©m Ã© muito perigoso. Imagine ter trilhÃµes de bombinhas no seuÂ  sangue, que podem explodir a qualquer momento. EntÃ£o, nossas cÃ©lulas usam numerososÂ  mecanismos para impedir que o complemento as ataque acidentalmente. Ok. O que exatamente ele faz e o que o torna tÃ£o perigoso? Em poucas palavras, o sistema complemento faz trÃªs coisas: Ele debilita os inimigos, ativa o sistema imunolÃ³gico e fura as coisas atÃ© elas morrerem. Mas como? Afinal, sÃ£o proteÃ­nas sem consciÃªncia, vagando aleatoriamente sem vontade ouÂ  direÃ§Ã£o. Bem, isso faz parte da estratÃ©gia. As proteÃ­nas do complemento flutuamÂ  de forma meio passiva. NÃ£o fazem nada. Isso atÃ© serem ativadas e mudarem de forma. No mundo das proteÃ­nas, sua forma determina o que vocÃª pode e nÃ£o pode fazer... ... porque a forma determina com o que vocÃª pode interagir, e de que maneira. Por exemplo, na forma passiva, vocÃª pode nÃ£o fazer nada. Na forma ativa, no entanto, vocÃª pode, por exemplo, alterar a forma de outras proteÃ­nas,Â  ativando-as para que possam ativar outras. Mecanismos como este podem iniciar umÂ  efeito cascata que se espalha rapidamente. Imagine as proteÃ­nas do complementoÂ  como milhÃµes de fÃ³sforos muito prÃ³ximos. Quando um pega fogo, ele acende outrosÂ  ao redor, e assim sucessivamente, atÃ© que de repente vocÃª tem um grande incÃªndio. Mostrar os mecanismos reais do sistema complemento Ã© um tanto complicado e desgastante,Â  entÃ£o, vamos simplificar um pouco. Vamos imaginar que vocÃª se cortou e um monte deÂ  bactÃ©rias entrou na ferida e nos tecidos ao redor. Nosso sistema complementoÂ  comeÃ§a atacando com a C3. A C3 Ã© o primeiro fÃ³sforo. A faÃ­sca inicial que comeÃ§arÃ¡ o incÃªndio. E para fazer isso, a C3 precisaÂ  mudar do estado passivo para o ativo. Como isso acontece Ã© complexo, masÂ  digamos que foi aleatoriamente, via outras proteÃ­nas do complemento queÂ  se ligam aos inimigos ou via anticorpos. O que vocÃª precisa saber Ã© que a C3Â  se divide em duas proteÃ­nas menores, a C3a e a C3b, que agora estÃ£o ativadas. Uma destas partes, a proteÃ­na C3b, Ã© como um mÃ­ssil teleguiado especializadoÂ  em bactÃ©rias, fungos e vÃ­rus. Ela tem uma fraÃ§Ã£o de segundo para achar a vÃ­timaÂ  ou serÃ¡ neutralizada por molÃ©culas de Ã¡gua. Se a C3b encontrar um alvo, ela vai se ancorarÂ  firmemente Ã  sua superfÃ­cie e nÃ£o vai soltar. Ao fazer isso, ela muda de forma novamente. Em sua nova forma, ela pode pegar outras proteÃ­nas e comeÃ§ar o efeito cascata, mudandoÂ  de forma vÃ¡rias vezes e adicionando mais proteÃ­nas do complemento a si prÃ³pria. Finalmente, ela se transforma numa plataforma de recrutamento conhecidaÂ  como C3 convertase. Essa plataforma Ã© especialista em ativarÂ  mais proteÃ­nas C3, que recomeÃ§am todo o ciclo. Inicia-se um ciclo de amplificaÃ§Ã£o. Em breve, milhares de proteÃ­nas cobrem a bactÃ©ria. Para a bactÃ©ria, isso Ã© muito ruim â€“ podemÂ  ficar incapacitada e indefesa ou desacelerada. Imagine ser coberto por milhares de moscas. Mas hÃ¡ ainda mais â€“ lembra da outra parte da proteÃ­na C3? A proteÃ­na C3a? A C3a Ã© como um sinalizador de perigo. Milhares delas fogem do campo da batalha gritandoÂ  por atenÃ§Ã£o. As cÃ©lulas imunes passivas veem as proteÃ­nas C3a e despertam do seu repouso paraÂ  seguir os seus rastros atÃ© o local da infecÃ§Ã£o. Quanto mais proteÃ­nas de alarmeÂ  encontram, mais agressivas ficam. Assim, o complemento direciona os reforÃ§osÂ  para o local exato onde Ã© mais necessÃ¡rio. AtÃ© agora, o complemento atrasouÂ  os invasores e pediu ajuda. Agora, comeÃ§a a ajudar a matar o inimigo.Â  As primeiras cÃ©lulas imunes a chegar ao campo de batalha sÃ£o os fagÃ³citos... ... ou seja, cÃ©lulas que engolem o inimigo inteiro, prendendo-o e matando-o depois com Ã¡cido. Mas para engolir o inimigo Ã© preciso agarrÃ¡-lo, o que nÃ£o Ã© fÃ¡cil, pois as bactÃ©rias nÃ£oÂ  querem ser agarradas e sÃ£o meio escorregadias. Mas quando o complemento se ancora nasÂ  bactÃ©rias, age como uma cola que ajuda as cÃ©lulas imunes a capturarem suas vÃ­timas. Mas fica ainda melhor. Imagine de novo estar coberto de moscas. Agora imagine as moscas se transformando em vespas. Outra cascata estÃ¡ prestes a comeÃ§ar. Na superfÃ­cie da bactÃ©ria, a plataformaÂ  de recrutamento C3 muda novamente de forma e comeÃ§a a recrutar novas proteÃ­nas. Elas se unem para construir uma estrutura maior: um Complexo de Ataque Ã  Membrana. PeÃ§a por peÃ§a, novas proteÃ­nas em forma de lanÃ§as se ancoram profundamenteÂ  nas membranas da bactÃ©ria. AtÃ© que abrem um buraco queÂ  jÃ¡ nÃ£o pode ser fechado. Fluidos entram na bactÃ©ria eÂ  suas entranhas se espalham. Ela sangra atÃ© a morte. As bactÃ©rias restantes sÃ£o mutiladas e distraÃ­das pelo complementoÂ  e rapidamente destruÃ­das pelas cÃ©lulas imunolÃ³gicas que chegam. A invasÃ£o teve fim antesÂ  mesmo de ter a chance de se tornar perigosa. E provavelmente, vocÃª nem reparou. Apesar das bactÃ©rias nÃ£o curtirem o complemento, os inimigos contra os quaisÂ  esse sistema pode ser mais Ãºtil sÃ£o os vÃ­rus. Os vÃ­rus tÃªm um problema: elesÂ  precisam viajar de cÃ©lula em cÃ©lula. Fora das cÃ©lulas, eles basicamente vagueiam atÃ©Â  encontrar, por acaso, uma cÃ©lula para infectar. Aqui, estÃ£o totalmente indefesos. E aqui o complemento os intercepta e os debilita, tornando-os inofensivos, guiandoÂ  entÃ£o o sistema imunolÃ³gico para devorÃ¡-los. Sem o complemento, as infecÃ§ÃµesÂ  virais seriam muito mais letais. Mas espera aÃ­. Se temos uma armaÂ  tÃ£o eficaz, por que adoecemos? O problema Ã© que, numa guerra,Â  os dois lados se adaptam. Por exemplo, ao infectar uma cÃ©lula, oÂ  vÃ­rus Vaccinia a faz produzir uma proteÃ­na que impede a ativaÃ§Ã£o do complemento. Desta forma, o vÃ­rus cria zonas seguras em torno das cÃ©lulas que infecta. Ao matÃ¡-las e tentar infectar mais, hÃ¡ maior probabilidade de ser bem-sucedido. Ou algumas bactÃ©rias podem, ainda, agarrar certas molÃ©culas do sangue que mantÃªmÂ  o sistema complemento calmo e ficar invisÃ­veis. Portanto, apesar de extremamente importante,Â  o sistema complemento Ã© sÃ³ um dos atores na complexa e bela organizaÃ§Ã£o queÂ  Ã© o nosso sistema imunolÃ³gico. Um belo exemplo de como coisas sem consciÃªnciaÂ  podem, juntas, fazer coisas inteligentes"
Hx9TwM4Pmhc,8:37,en,false,true,ok,,"This is a water jet pack... but no, that's not me flying it. This is me. It's harder than it looks, ok? But to understand how it works, we need to first talk rocket science. Rocket science is meant to be one of the most complicated things in the world, but the basic principle is incredibly simple. It's just Newton's 3rd law -- all forces come in pairs, which are equal and opposite. To demonstrate this, I'm using a fire extinguisher on a skateboard. As the carbon dioxide is forced out the back of the extinguisher, it puts a force forwards on me causing me to accelerate. Or that's the theory anyway. If you look closely, you can spot the exact moment I realize this is a fail. So what was the problem here? Well the force applied to me by the carbon dioxide is equal to the rate of mass ejected out the back of the fire extinguisher, call it m-dot for short, multiplied by the velocity of that exhaust gas. So in this case the carbon dioxide wasn't ejected fast enough to create a big enough force and overcome the small frictional forces to get me to accelerate. But it can be done as has been demonstrated many times on Youtube. When the space shuttle lifts off, exhaust gasses exit the nozzle at 3 to 4 km/s, ejecting an amount of mass of 9000 kg/s. This creates thrust equal to 30,000,000 N or the equivalent of about 2 million decent fire extinguishers. Now imagine you are an astronaut preparing for launch in the space shuttle. You'd be seated not vertically but horizontally, perpendicular to the acceleration. That's because the human body is a bit like a water balloon where the water represents your blood and the balloon represents your harder parts like your skeleton. Now, if you are accelerated up really quickly, then your skeleton accelerates up at that rate but your blood tends to stay where it is. And this results in the blood ending up in your feet. Now since there's not enough oxygen going to your brain you would black out. But fighter pilots face an arguably worse fate when they accelerate down too fast, because then the blood all rushes to their head and they suffer something called a red-out, where the blood actually comes out of their eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. But back to astronauts, since you are reclined, at worst the blood will end up in the back of your body and the back of your head, but your brain will still have enough oxygen to remain conscious. Now as the spacecraft lifts off and starts speeding up, the acceleration is initially a very reasonable five to eight meters per second squared - that's less acceleration than an object in free fall here at the surface of Earth. But as the spacecraft continues to burn fuel, its mass decreases, while the thrust remains essentially constant. Now Newton's second law says that the acceleration of an object equals the net force applied to it divided by its mass. So as the mass decreases, the acceleration increases -- and it increases at an increasing rate. So much so that at the end of the rocket burn the thrust has to actually be limited in order to keep the acceleration from going over three g's -- that's three times the acceleration due to gravity or about 30 meters per second squared. Now the term g-force has been invented to give a sense of the amount of force experienced by astronauts, in multiples of the force we experience everyday. Right now you are experiencing one g-force, probably on your butt if you're sitting down -- can you feel that force? But accelerating at three g's you would experience three g-forces. So the force between your back and the chair would be the same as if you had two of you stacked on top of you. Hey, pipe down below, huh? You guys are heavy. Oh, man. You know that feeling when you're taking off in a plane and it feels like you're pressed into the seat, well really it's the seat pressing into you. But if you imagine that feeling times 20, that's what it would be like to be taking off in the space shuttle. Now an interesting side note is that we think of the space shuttle's acceleration as being mainly vertical because that's what we see when it lifts off. But that's actually not true. Once the space shuttle exits the thicker part of the atmosphere, it turns horizontal and accelerates up to its orbital velocity 28,000 km/h. So most of the acceleration of a spacecraft, in orbit anyway, is horizontal. So how is this like a jet pack? Well unlike the shuttle, you don't carry your own propellant with you. And also, there's no chemical reaction releasing energy that drives the propellant downwards. Instead the jetski pumps water out of the lake and up that hose at a rate up to 60 litres per second. And then right on these nozzles here, the water changes directions. So it goes from coming up to being fired out the bottom, and that change in momentum as it goes over the bend is what actually pushed the jetpack up. Because the jetpack's pushing down on the water, so by Newton's third law, the water has to push up on the jetpack generating 1800 Newtons of thrust, that's roughly equivalent to 150 decent fire extinguishers. This could accelerate me at up to 1.5 g's And you use your hands in order to steer. Lifting up to drive yourself upwards, moving your hands down to accelerate forwards, and pretend like you're turning a big wheel very gently in order to turn side to side. One thing you don't want to do is try to explain the physics of the jetpack while in the air. That's what I was trying to do here... While you're learning your thrust is controlled by your instructor so if he sees you doing something stupid he'll just turn off the thrust and drop you into the lake so you don't hurt yourself. That's generally a good idea unless you're on a collision course with the jetski. I got a pretty fat lip from doing this but thankfully all my teeth were intact. When the thrust is equal to my weight plus the weight of the water in the hose, then I can hover or move with constant velocity. It's a common misconception that you need a little bit of unbalanced force to move with a constant velocity -- in truth if the forces are balanced, you will continue moving with whatever constant velocity you have. The other common misconception about rockets is that you need something to push off like the atmosphere. In reality, what you are pushing off is the propellant, so even without the air around a water jetpack would still work because you're pushing off the water that is coming out those nozzles. If you want to go jetpacking I recommend you go easy on the controls. I mean the worst thing you can do is overcompensate, which I think is a typical human reaction, because you're reacting to where you are and how fast you're moving and you're not reacting to acceleration which is the real thing that you can control. So even if you're coming down towards the water quite quickly you may be slowing down so it may be ok and you don't need to adjust anything. You just need to trust that the jetpack will get you out of any trouble. It's a pretty incredibly experience, feeling the power of that water rushing passed you. It's the closest I've gotten to flying really. That's the power of physics.

WP4Tn36FCg0,8:46,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person in today's video we're going to be talking a little bit more about black holes and the theory behind them and introduce some of the new research about these wonderful creations in the universe anyway welcome to what the math so I was actually watching a video from Kursk assault which is another youtuber or a YouTube channel that I believe is German for in a nutshell and they were actually talking about a very interesting blackhole hypothesis specifically touching on things like information paradox now in this video the they do pretty good job explaining certain things but they also speculate about various things like for example what happens when black holes evaporate completely and so what I actually wanted to do in this video is mention some of the history behind black holes and also just explain the information paradox and kind of give you an idea of what we think will actually happen to black holes once they evaporate so first of all what exactly is information paradox well in a nutshell it talks about the idea of everything falling into a black hole that you know has information like for example the information about how many atoms are in your body and what kind of atoms they are and how they're structured all of this is information and when it falls into a black hole it technically may disappear now in 1975 Stephen Hawking the most famous black hole scientists study the behavior of the so called quantum matter in the vicinity of black hole and basically showed that well first of all there's no way back from a black hole second of all they're not really black they actually emit thermal radiation just like hot objects but he also speculated that it's very likely that information is lost once it enters a black hole and his reasoning behind this was that well you know a radiation from the surface of a black hole is very limited it actually is formed by these particles and antiparticles that are kind of split into two and I've talked about this concept previously if you wanna check out one of the previous videos but the idea is that it's only determined by few parameters it's not enough to represent the entire information but in the late 90s other developments in physics specifically the string theory convinced the researchers that information that falls into a black hole must come out when the black hole evaporates now how this happens is still very unclear and one of the reasons why it's called information paradox is that whoa we believe time and space are connected and they can basically go either way frontwards or backwards in other words you could go back in time I imagine if if you fall into a black hole if your information disappears if you were to rewind time how would information form out of nothing so in other words if you were to literally rewind time nothing can just create something out of a black hole so this information has to be stored somewhere and that's essentially the idea behind this information paradox the information that goes inside black hole must be stored somewhere in the black hole now as of 2017 we're actually still not entirely sure what exactly is happening on the surface of a black hole but what most scientists argue today is that when it comes to at least electromagnetic energy for example photons since there is actually infinite number of new charged particles on the surface of a black hole there are probably infinite number of quantum software soft hairs that a black hole can support now what is the soft hair well in a nutshell it's basically a low energy quantum excitation it's an excitation in the actual quantity itself that releases information when the black hole evaporates well maybe the picture will do a slightly better job now think of it as an energy excitation on a surface of a black hole on microscopic levels so analysis must be repeated for the gravity of course because that only talks about photons so we don't really know if this is actually something that applies to everything but nevertheless these soft hair they introduced is probably something that we'll need to study a little bit more but also it's unfortunately not enough to capture all the information about what falls into a black hole so once again if you fall into a black hole this soft hair theory is not enough to explain what happens to your information over time as the black hose collectors information today some scientists speculate that all of this information is somehow stored on the surface and basically this three-dimensional information is turn into two-dimensional information and in a sense it becomes kind of like a hologram on the surface of a black hole now what happens to all of this afterwards now that's of course another question our black holes actually tiny time bombs that will eventually result in this huge huge explosion of all this information possible even cruelly creates completely new universes from from all of this information that stored in them well that's of course something that we won't know until the future until one of the black holes actually reaches the end of its days and since the evaporation of a black hole is a very slow process the so called Hawking radiation takes like billions billions billions of years to evaporate even the smallest black hole into into non-existence we won't really see any of this happening anytime soon but theoretically at least when a black hole evaporates it can no longer hold this information so what's going to happen to it afterwards so will all this information just be left as a kind of a crystal basically an unusual component that just stays there after the black hole evaporates or will it actually suddenly explode creating a completely new universe and possibly result in a new Big Bang essentially will a black hole eventually create a new universe and if this new universe is created is this how our universe started now some scientists still think that black holes store information in some kind of a basically like a tiny pixel a quantum particle that is really really small on the surface of this black hole but if a black hole becomes smaller and smaller what happens to these tiny pixels and although maybe some of the information is actually carried away by the Hawking radiation as the black hole evaporates will this actually release all of the information or will some of it still be stored inside and thus generates some kind of a information bubble at the end when the black hole's gone so all of this is actually very interesting but possibly might give us an idea of how universe actually behaves how it's born and how it dies and for all we know maybe a long time ago our universe was also a black hole that basically exploded and well that's all I wanted to talk about in this video and hopefully you enjoyed it and if you did don't forget to subscribe check out some of the other black hole videos and share this video with someone who enjoys learning about space sciences I'll see you guys tomorrow space out and as always bye bye
QImCld9YubE,10:16,en,false,true,ok,,"At this very second, you are on a narrow ledge between life and death. You probably don't feel it, but there's an incredible amount of activity going on inside you, and this activity can never stop. Picture yourself as a Slinky falling down  an escalator moving upwards. The falling part represents the self-replicating processes of your cells. The escalator represents the laws of physics driving you forwards. To be alive is to be in motion but never arriving anywhere. If you reach the top of the escalator, there's no more falling possible, and you are dead forever. Somewhat unsettlingly, the universe wants you to reach the top. How do you avoid that? And why are you alive? [Amazing-sounding Kurz Intro Music] All life is based on the cell. A cell is a piece of the dead universe that separated itself from the rest so it could do its own thing for a while. When this separation breaks down, it dies and joins the rest of the dead universe again. Unfortunately, the universe would like for life to be done with doing its own thing. For some reason, it's not a fan of exciting things, but tries to be as boring as possible. We call this principle ""entropy,"" and it's a fundamental rule of our universe. It's pretty complicated and counterintuitive, so we'll explain it in detail in another video. For now, all you need to know is living things are inherently exciting. A cell is filled up with millions of proteins and millions more simpler molecules like water. Thousands of complex, self-replicating processes are happening up to hundreds of thousands of times every second. To stay alive and exciting, it has to constantly work to keep itself from achieving entropy and becoming boring and dead. The cell has to maintain a separation from the rest of the universe. It's doing this, for example, by keeping the concentration of certain molecules different on the inside and the outside by actively pumping out excess molecules. To do stuff like this, a cell needs energy. Energy is the ability of things in the universe to do work; to move or manipulate a thing; to create change. This ability cannot be created or destroyed. The set amount of energy in the universe will never change. We don't know why, it just is that way. So, billions of years ago, one of the most crucial challenges for the first living beings was to get usable energy. We don't know a lot about the first cells, except that they got their energy from simple chemical reactions. And they found the ultimate energy transfer system: the energetic building block of life. The molecule Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP. Its structure makes it uniquely good at accepting and releasing energy. When a cell needs energy, for example, to pump out molecules or to repair a broken micro machine, it can break down ATP, and use the chemical energy to do work and create change. This is why living beings are able to do stuff. We don't know when or how exactly the first ATP molecule was made on earth. But every living thing we know uses ATP, or something very similar, to keep its internal machinery running. It's crucial for almost every process. Plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals need to survive. Without ATP, no life on Earth. Possibly anywhere. While breaking down chemicals for energy is nice and all, early life did miss out on the greatest available source of energy: The Sun. The Sun merges atoms and radiates photons away that carry energy into the solar system. But this energy is raw and indigestible. It needs to be refined. After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, finally, a cell figured out how to eat the Sun. It absorbed radiation and converted much of it into neat little chemical packages that it could use to stay alive. We call this process: Photosynthesis. You take photons that are wobbly with electromagnetic energy, and use a part of this energy to merge and combine different molecules together. The electromagnetic energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the ATP molecule. This process became even better, as some cells learned to create better chemical packages: Glucose, or sugar. Easy to break down, high in energy, and pretty tasty. This is so convenient, that some cells decided that instead of doing all that pesky photosynthesis work themselves, they would just swallow other cells that did, and take their glucose and ATP. This is widely considered one of the biggest anime betrayals in evolutionary history. And so things went on. Photosynthesizing cells could mostly harness energy at their surfaces, which limited their maximum energy production, which limited their evolutionary avenues somewhat. So, time passed. Some cells made sugar, others ate them. Evolution did its thing, but overall things stayed pretty much the same for hundreds of millions of years. Until, one day, a cell ate another, and did not kill it. Instead, they became one cell. Nothing had changed that day, but Earth would be different forever. This cell became the ancestor of all animals on this planet. Blue whales, amoeba. Dinosaurs, jellyfish. Pink fairy armadillos, and Sunda colugos. And of course, you. All can trace back their existence to this moment. The merging of two living beings is so important, because when those two cells became one, they became way more powerful. The formerly independent cell in the inside, could stop trying to survive. It could concentrate on one thing: make ATP. It became the powerhouse of the cell: the first mitochondria. The host cell's job became to ensure survival in the dangerous world, and provide the mitochondria with food. Mitochondria basically reverse photosynthesis, in a similarly complex process. They take sugar molecules that we got from eating other living things, combust them with oxygen and precursor molecules, to make new, energy-rich ATP molecules. This process works like a tiny furnace and spits out waste products like CO2, water, and a little bit of kinetic energy that you experience as body heat. This first division of labor, meant the new cell had way more energy available than any cell before, which meant more possibilities for evolution to enable more complex cells. At some point, these cells began to form small groups or communities, which lead to multicellular life, and finally, to you. Today, you are a pile of trillions of cells, each filled with dozens, if not hundreds of little machines that provides you with usable energy to stay alive. If this process is interrupted, even for a few minutes, you die. (Teaser of Kurzgesagt: Science War, coming in 2021.) But if life is so fragile, wouldn't it be a good idea to store ATP, like we store sugar in our fat cells, so we don't die if we stop breathing for a while? If life has solved so many problems to make you live today, what's up with the dying quickly thing? Even simple bacteria like E. Coli make about 50 times their body weight in ATP for every cell division. Your trillions of cells need a lot of ATP to keep you around. Every day, your body produces and converts about 90 million, billion, billion molecules of ATP: about your own body weight. You need a whole person's worth of ATP just to make it through a single day. Even storing enough ATP to last you a few minutes is basically impossible. An ATP molecule is really good for shifting energy around quickly, but it's terrible for storage, since it has only one percent of a glucose molecule's energy at three times its mass. So ATP is constantly produced and used up fairly quickly. This was the short and simplified story of the molecule that allows you to be different from the dead universe, and to be the slinky on the escalator. It is a weird story. There is this molecule you need to survive at all times. You need it to keep moving, because even a short break brings your slinky to a stop. And you need to make it yourself. It's like driving a car at full speed while producing fuel in the trunk with junk that you pick up from the side of the road. As far as we know, this all began billions of years ago, when tiny parts of the dead universe came together and became something else for a moment. It could keep itself going. It could grow. That moment set the slinky in motion, and it's been going ever since. From the very first cells, to you watching this now. At some point, you will merge with the rest of the dead universe again. Maybe you'll tell it stories about your adventures. Maybe not. But before you find out, you get to do what life does best. Making a dead universe, much more interesting. (With a Supreme Slinky poster in your room.) *Quack* Duck: Why am I floating with no purpose in this universe?"
JSd3vI2247o,12:06,en,true,true,ok,,"hello on full person this is Anton and well you're probably familiar with luminescence the ability of different types of life to basically glow or essentially form light by chemical means and interestingly this is a surprisingly successful adaptation it's even been suggested that it evolved separately at least 94 times in the history of life but surprisingly for very different reasons and it actually occurs in a lot of different types of life for example we know of several fungi that can glow in the dark so yeah there are glowing mushrooms out there different types of insects such as this gloworm different types of marine life such as jellyfish and of course different types of actual fish such as the famous angler fish that somehow develop the ability to control this with their brain and thus use it for basically catching prey but all of these diverse examples also show us that bioluminescence potentially has very different Origins and obviously has very different uses with the overall molecular process usually being somewhat similar it involves small molecules very often referred to as luciferin that react with oxygen in the presence of a very specific protein or an enzyme sometimes referred to as Lucifer rays and this unusual reaction that produces a huge amount of energy surprisingly releases all of this energy as light as a matter of fact it's up to 90% efficient which is actually really crazy because LED lights are only 20% efficient and so this unusual reaction that seems to exist in a lot of different species sometimes results in a production of visible light but depending on the organism it's used for different purposes Al interestingly attracting mates seems to be a very common one and the scientists have always been curious about well okay how exactly did all of this evolve why did it evolve and what was the first type of an organism or basically is there some kind of a general mechanism responsible for producing so many different variations and potentially some kind of a mechanism that can lead us to additional discoveries and so naturally they started looking for some of the first organisms that possibly had bioluminescence and one of the first discoveries from a few years back was the evidence for bioluminesence in these unusual crustations these are known as ostra cods and they're basically kind of like tiny shrimps up to maybe 8 mm in length that seem to have survived for a very long time but more specifically are known to produce bioluminescence and are actually usually the ones responsible for so-called Blue Sand the phenomenon that's actually visible on a lot of different beaches around the world and so some of the previous evidence based on a lot of different archaeological records established that even 267 million years ago these unusual crustations already produced by alumin ains and they seem to do this only for one purpose sexual display it's basically a way for them to attract mates and it's a potentially a very successful strategy because their offspring is still around and they've been doing all of this for nearly 300 million years but the question is really to figure out who was the first and possibly why and they don't seem to be the first as a matter of fact we now know they're not because the scientists have just discovered something that's even older the new study that as always you can find any description below focused on something that we know survived much longer corals and actually more specifically OCTA corals one of the oldest animals on the planet that tend to produce eight side symmetry which is why they're called OCTA corals you don't actually see the Symmetry in this picture because in this case these animals are also Colony based in other words this is actually a collection of tiny tiny creatures all building a huge Colony by connecting into one large piece and just like so many other corals they also have a relatively complex life cycle that includes Plankton stage where they get to swim around and the sessile stage where they basically attach to something forming a colony but unlike a lot of other corals they don't have a hard shell and that's actually what makes them so unusual and so unique their OU shell is soft and even their inner shell or inner skeleton is kind of soft as well even though it sometimes contains a little bit of calcium and so what do you do when you're such a softy especially when you live in an area where everything tries to basically eat you well you got to evolve with the times and you got to come up with a new strategy and it looks like their strategy is basically bioluminesence they glow when touched and that means that you can basically see them from far away even in darkness but why would they light up when something tries to touch them well today the researchers believe that it's actually to attract the potential predators of the prey that's trying to eat them and so if a tiny fish is trying to nibble at these unusual corals it tells everyone to come and eat the fish at least that's the current explanation now obviously the actual reason might be a little bit different and the bioluminescence in a lot of different animals is still a bit mysterious but because these corals are so ancient it was obviously worth exploring this in order to find that source of bioluminesence in animals especially because one of the recent studies finally created a kind of a genetic tree for a lot of different species of OCTA corals focusing on 18 five different taxa and so tracing the origins became just a little bit easier but strangely enough we know that today only some OCTA corals are bioluminescent whereas others seem to have lost the ability which is also an intriguing question by itself why and so here by combining ancestors of bioluminescent corals with non-bioluminescent ones the researchers were able to work out which of the ancestors was also most likely to be bioluminescent as well event landing on a common ancestor approximately 540 million years ago now we don't actually know exactly what the ancestor was but based on the genetic statistical analysis that's essentially what it shows us and this type of analysis is actually pretty common in a lot of genetic studies this is for example how we know that there was a major bottleneck in human population just over 70,000 years ago as well you can learn about this in one of the videos in the description and so back then the Earth was obviously very different and the complex life and even multicell life was still just starting and becoming more complex but we know that around this time I started to evolve as well and that basically implied that there was probably already some kind of an inter species interaction at this time because bioluminescence implies that you're trying to communicate with someone and in case of corals very likely not someone of your own species these corals don't have the ability to perceive light and so here they were definitely trying to get someone else's attention and not someone else had to have eyes to see the light but the obvious question is if the ancestors back then had the bioluminesence abilities why do so many corals today don't and how exactly did all of this get lost now these questions don't really have answers yet but it kind of helps us to start answering the questions about how and why bioluminescence even exists and some of these initial explanations are kind of interesting for example we know that most of the bioluminesence is usually in marine animals and so during the time sometimes referred to as the snowball Earth when the oceans were covered by ice and were obviously very dark there might have been some kind of a natural selection for animals to basically form larger and more sensitive eyes but also an ability to see things or to even produce light naturally basically leading to a lot of marine organisms developing this unusual ability but there's actually another explanation that goes even farther back in time and involves something a little bit more exciting and it actually suggests that all of this might have started as a result of a mutation for a protein that was supposed to do something entirely different at first over 2 billion years ago we know that Earth went through the event known as great oxygenation a sudden influx of oxygen that was potentially caused by a sudden increase in photosynthetic organisms and we know that this was also probably one of the first major Extinction events because oxygen is actually kind of toxic it creates a lot of reactive ox oen species that can produce major damage to a lot of different types of life and so in order to protect themselves certain bacteria Were Somehow able to evolve a new type of mechanism an oxygenase enzyme that would use other molecules to remove all this oxygen protecting the bacteria in the process through a very active energy producing reaction with all this extra energy potentially used for something else and so it basically served as a kind of an antioxidant but at some point obviously through mutation some of these oxygenase enzymes evolve to not just produce energy but to also produce light at some point resulting in some of the first bioluminesence that eventually found its use basically Shifting the function from just protection from oxygen to now possibly communication sexual display looking for or catching prey and so on and so the genes responsible for all of this potentially stayed with us for a very long time which is why so many different species were able to evolve bioluminescence over and over again mostly because these antioxidant enzymes still exist in a lot of different species and occasionally can mutate to become bioluminescent or at least that's one of many many explanations for how all of this potentially started and though we don't actually know the exact set of ecological circumstances that produce this unusual phenomenon on the planet we now know that it definitely started at least 540 million years ago but I'm sure there will be more to learn in some of the future studies and we'll definitely talk about all of this once they come out as well and so until then thank you for watching subscribe share this with someone who lot about

2PYG_upOxUc,12:20,en,true,true,ok,,"hello person this is Anton and today once again we're going to discuss some of the new studies about our friend be juice be juice be juice nope still hasn't appeared anyway so yeah that super giant star that surprised everyone back in 2019 when it decided to suddenly start diming by quite a lot and this lasted for several months eventually becoming known as the great demon event and even though additional observations have now concluded that it's extremely unlikely that this was signs of some kind of a upcoming Supernova and was most likely the result of some kind of a dust cloud emitted by the star because a lot of the details are still murky and because there have been several other studies in the last 3 years discussing additional propositions were essentially stuck with a bit of a mystery why exactly did this happen and just recently like a few days ago there's been another study another Super interesting and very intriguing proposition that in essence suggests that Beetle juu may not be just a single star and potentially does have a partner that we just cannot see and if correct this would actually change quite a lot about Beetle Juice but would also explain so many things we've observed in the last few decades and so let's discuss this in a little bit more detail but let's also briefly discuss some of the recent propositions that have not been proven yet but do present us with a somewhat intriguing scenario for example in one of the previous videos with the links for these videos in the description below researchers essentially try to figure out is B juice going to go supernova soon or is it possibly not going to go supernova for a very long time and surprisingly there were actually so many different very solid explanations that all produced pretty much opposite results for example some studies suggested that this star was a result of a collision of two separate Stars which would explain why it's spinning so fast and may actually stay the same and not change much for a very very long time much much longer than we initially thought whereas other studies ended up with opposite conclusions one of the most recent studies actually suggested that it might even go supernova within the next few decades maximum several hundred years and this is actually based on something entirely different so as some of you may know Beetle Juice that you can kind of see right here in the infrared like so many other stars is a variable star in other words it does not have a constant brightness and you can actually see this pretty easily by looking at freely available graph of its light curves that shows us how the brightness changes over a period of approximately 6 years and that big dip in the middle that's the great dimming but you can see that even before the great dimming it was actually going brighter and darker at least several times per year and so these unusual Cycles even though they're not perfectly understood can generally be predicted pretty well but in the last few years scientists realized something else by looking at a much longer term we can actually see another unusual pattern another cycle that's approximately 2100 days long that's known as an LSP a long secondary period and today we know that quite a lot of giant Stars seem to possess these LSPs in general these are usually seen in many cool very bright stars such as red giant Branch stars or rgbs yellow hyper Giants and red super Giants would many of them possess in cycles of anything from hundreds to sometimes thousands of days long with approximately 30% of all large Stars possessing these Cycles you can find out about all of this in one of the older papers that should be in the description and today we believe that a lot of these Cycles seem to suggest something extremely unusual about these stars but the exact explanation is still not certain what is certain though is that they do seem to end up in very unusual asymmetric planetary nebula or super NOA that are basically bilobal and so in many of these stars for some reason they seem to contain that secondary pulsation that's usually approximately 10 times longer than the primary pulsation yet these LSPs or long secondary periods present us with a bit of a mystery and the Mystery here is that which of these Cycles is really the primary cycle because that's actually really important we know that as a lot of these stars become older and basically come closer to that transition to the Supernova or some kind of a planetary nebula their Cycles usually grow longer and longer and so knowing how long the actual primary cycle is is super important at least if you want to figure out what's going to happen to the star and when and so for Beetle Juice trying to understand what the primary cycle is is obviously kind of important because if that primary cycle turns out to be that longer cycle that's about 2100 days long you would actually suggest that Beetle Juice is much much older and based on the calculations for this LSP researchers believe it might only have a few decades or maybe a couple of centuries left before it actually does go supernova producing a really bright event almost as bright as the full moon and so in the last few years the big question became is that 2100 day cycle it's fundamental mode is this the main variability cycle suggesting that the star is much older because this would actually place the evolution of Beetle Juice beyond the onset of the carbon burning and implying that the Supernova might be imminent but if this is a secondary period then it's still very likely is burning helium and is thus unlikely to go supernova for several hundred thousand years possibly even up to a million years and so just to give you a super brief summary here we had two propositions one is that the primary note or the brightness variation was approximately 420 days long suggesting be juice will probably survive for hundreds of thousands of years and the second proposition was that the cycle was 21 100 days suggesting that b juice only had like a few decades left with this proposition obviously being more exciting just for the sakes of Science and I guess um Fireworks uh this one maybe not so exciting but also a lot more likely and so as a result a lot of recent studies essentially focused on that main question and so the most recent study potentially discovered one of the best explanations we have so far here Jared Goldberg Meredith Joyce and Las moer propose a body for ble juice maybe there's actually a hidden partner that explains the secondary cycle and actually explains the great de as well potentially covering all of the Mysteries all at once with the actual proposition being relatively simple beu juice might have a much smaller partner maybe just a little bit more massive than our own Sun that seems to orbit around it every 2100 days in the process producing all sorts of effects for example the brightness variation involves a somewhat complex formation and removal of dust usually along the line of sight from planet Earth and once in a while when this dust becomes clumped in certain ways it might actually end up in one of the L Ranch points and gets expelled in such a way that it produces a much bigger demon event which is what they believe might have happened in 2019 because according to their model that event happened during the so-called LSP minimum which is essentially when this partner hypothetical partner would be kind of pointing in the direction of planet Earth but if this is so why is it that we're actually not seeing anything and where exactly is the star hiding well the explanation to this is relatively simple as well be juice is ridiculously bright it's about 10,000 times brighter than the Sun and so if the star here orbits with a period of 2100 days it's actually just close enough to beo juice where it's going to be practically invisible in most frequencies of light and that's because this star would be very similar in brightness to our sun right next to an object that's about 10,000 times brighter and so the only way we could ever see this is by maybe observing various changes in dust and Radial velocity for at least several decades which could then maybe show us that the dust here moves in a very specific way circling around as if something is orbiting around the star and so basically detecting the star if it's just a regular star would be very very challenging but if it's a white dwarf or if it's maybe a neutron star which is somewhat unlikely but I guess could exist we might be able to see certain variations in the x-rays which as far as I know have not been detected yet but assuming the age of Beetle Juice at 10 million years and assuming two stars here formed at the same time we can basically make some estimates about what's going on so obviously the radius and mass of Beetle Juice don't really change much but it now has a partner known as orionis B that's just a little bit more massive than the Sun and is approximately 1,850 radi of the Sun away from the center so I guess it would be just a little bit farther away from the edge of Beetle Juice not really touching it but extremely close this would be approximately 8.6 astronomical units away from the center and if this hypothesis is correct this could be some kind of a low mass pre-main sequence star that's still developing and potentially even has some kind of a protoplanetary disc and obviously the disc here would be very likely extremely Disturbed it's the interaction between the disc and the dust from Beetle Juice that could possibly lead us to one day Discover it and so interestingly enough right now this is the best explanation we have for this unusual 2100 day periodicity even though there are other explanations like for example giant cell convections mod interactions non-radial pulsations or even unusual dust modulation it's really the partner that seems to easily explain everything we've seen so far in the Last 5 Years pretty well and obviously if correct he would also suggest that ble juice as mentioned before is unlikely to go supernova anytime soon it probably has at least a few hundred thousand years left and may even survive longer depending on what happens with a partner but once it does go supernova it's probably going to be very unique and produce an extremely unusual Remnant while also dramatically changing his partner potentially turning it into a slightly different star but obviously for now at least this is just a hypothesis and therefore it needs a lot more evidence and once someone does discover some evidence we'll come back and talk more about this in some of the future videos until then check out other videos on Beetle Juice in some of the links in the description thank you for watching subscribe share this with someone who lot space and Sciences come back tomorrow to learn something

_lcFObGTK48,12:19,en,true,true,ok,,"hello INF full person this is Anton and well today we're going to discuss something a little bit more unusual and it's something in regards to our health and specifically as the title of this video suggests we're going to discuss a relatively recent study that makes a very strong suggestion that basically our body can absorb a lot of stuff including a lot of vitamins simply through the process of breathing in other words breathing doesn't just absorb oxygen which is technically a nutrient too but in nutrient essential for basic bodily functions looks like our noses and our lungs can also absorb a lot of other stuff that our bodies actually need and so let's discuss these studies and these discoveries in a little bit more detail but I guess let's start with the obvious to date most of the research on breathing respiratory system and various health effects in regards to air have been basically focused on pollution or essentially filtering out bad things in order to improve our health but intriguingly the idea of beneficial inhalation or basically inhaling things we either need or that can make us healthier has been mostly ignored in the last few decades and here for I guess obvious reasons in a typical breath we don't actually find a lot of stuff and a lot of nutrients with only minuscule quantities present in most of the air around us nevertheless every single culture in the world always valued fresh air as being healthy and as improving one's Health with a question being why and and what exactly is it in the air that can actually make us healthier Well turns out there has been quite a lot of research about this but it's kind of been forgotten in other words there is strong evidence that we do absorb a lot of stuff from the air including import nutrients which are usually referred to as Aeron nutrients and in theory these Aeron nutrients can easily serve as a supplement to our diet providing us with Essentials such as iodine zinc manganese and quite a lot of vit but what exactly is this evidence and how would any of this work well here we have to remember a really important fact even though a single breath of air is not going to contain a lot of nutrients whereas a single mouth full of food is going to contain quite a lot in comparison to eating we breathe way more we actually breathe in approximately 9,000 L of air every single day and even if there's just a little bit of stuff in that air it is going to ad up pretty quickly over time and unlike eating breathing doesn't actually stop and so even small concentration in the air adds up really quickly and though at first it might sound a little bit farfetched there's actually been quite a lot of research and quite a lot of evidence about this from various studies in the ' 50s and in the' 60s for example here's a really intriguing study from 1964 they discovered something really bizarre when studying male laundry workers here because these workers back then were exposed to a lot of iodine in the air when tested turn out to actually have much higher iodine in their blood and in their urine in essence suggesting that they basically inhale this iodine while working in the laundry and the conclusion here was that iodine can be absorbed from the atmosphere as you probably know iodine is quite important for us and is essentially required for various thyroid hormones intriguingly in a much more recent study from 2011 Smith and his team discovered that kids that lived in a seaweed rich areas usually somewhere near the coast also had very highly elevated iodine levels in their urine and more importantly were less likely to be iodine deficient than kids living in a city or away from the ocean and here this was directly correlated with the iodine levels in the atmosphere most of this was actually coming from the seaweed that was growing along the coast and much more importantly it was independent of their diet a lot of them were not even eating seaweed yet still had higher iodine with this too suggesting that Airborne iodine can easily serve as a supplement just as well as the dietary iodine so iodine in this case is definitely an Aeron nutrient likewise manganese and zinc seem to also serve a very similar role they can actually easily enter the brain through various neurons inside the nose that usually produces the sense of smell and both are also essential nutrients and manganes in this case is actually kind of tricky because you do do need it but too much of it can be damaging as a matter of fact it is neurotoxic in very large amounts and intriguingly back in 2014 this is kind of what was discovered in various welders now you might be familiar with the smell of metal when someone is welding nearby but basically this smell especially when working with manganese basically becomes an AER nutrient as well and so in welders who are usually exposed to high levels when they work quite large harmful levels of Manganese have been detected in the past suggesting that for many professions where there might be Metals in the air this has to be considered for health reasons so here You' probably want to wear a mask but even as far back as 1953 researchers were already aware of aerosolized vitamins potentially being beneficial for various deficiencies in this case it was the use of B12 vitamin that was used in the aerosolized form in order to treat something known as pernicious anemia and this can be very important for anyone who follows vegan diet for anyone who's older or for people with diabetes and in this case because it was actually shown to be a very effective and a very safe technique in theory this could be applied to a lot of different vitamins and a lot of different nutrients that someone might be lacking in other words a lot of nutrients and vitamins can be actually introduced in the air for example in someone's apartment especially if they're deficient in it and obviously someone might say yeah but why can't they just take some kind of a multivitamin pill or B basically just eat it in some cases this might not be the perfect answer and that's because when we breathe something in or basically when it comes to air absorption our lungs and even particles inside our nose are extremely efficient at absorbing things eventually injecting everything into our bodies and that's because the tiny blood vessels that are usually responsible for basically introducing things into our bodies have a much more direct access through the respiratory system compared to the digestive system when we eat something our gut first breaks the substance down into really tiny enzymes and various acids and all of this then has to be processed by bacteria before it can even enter the bloodstream in order to be metabolized and detoxified by the liver and when it comes to digestion our gun is actually specialized at absorbing sugars starches and various amino acids but not so much for things like vitamins or a lot of other nutrients that are also necessary in comparison when we breathe something even during the first few seconds as the air enters our nose various particles from the air already get absorbed into our blood for example both in the nose and inside our lungs there are these tiny hairlike structures called cyia here's actually a picture from the lungs that contains special receptors that easily bind to many different molecules including of course these Aeron nutrients in order to then directly absorb them into blood and here from various studies researchers know that the Celia can easily bind manganese zinc magnesium iron amino acids vitamin C calcium and a lot of other stuff and so a lot of these Aeron nutrients can easily enter our bodies through these huge networks inside our nose and inside our lungs and even smaller parts like the olfactory epithelium the area that detects the smell with each area basically being specialized at delivering certain nutrients to our bloodstream and as I mentioned before thefactory epithelium the sense of smell can actually deliver everything directly to the brain and much more importantly this Celia in our lungs can easily absorb very large molecules much larger than anything than can be absorbed inside our guts as a matter of fact in this study by Patton and Byron they discovered that inhaling drugs might be a much better way compared to ingesting them and so basically here we're talking about really large molecules that would be considered to be medicine which would be basically useless if we swallow them but would be very useful if they're inhaled things like nicotine for example and a lot of different anesthetics basically work by being inhaled and so it should not come as a surprise that a lot of other stuff will work too and because here we need much lower concentrations and much lower amounts to make this effective in some sense this might also be the future of the medical field instead of swallowing things we might start breathing them in but here we obviously reach the level of our ignorance at this point this is still very very early research and we don't even know exactly what to qualify as an Aeron nutrient or what locations on the planet for example might be beneficial to improve our health so for example is the ocean area better than the forest or is it even better to be somewhere higher up in the mountains and this type of research is particularly important for locations where air is usually filtered or processed in some way for example inside an airplane anyone who travels by air quite a lot might be seriously affected by this and may need to track their nutrients at all times and so this basically suggests that there's this entirely new medical field that needs to be studied because we don't really understand the effects well enough and this is obviously super important for anyone living in a city because of modern urbanization and because so many of us live in areas with relatively poor air understanding air nutrients and how they affect our health can dramatically improve life for anyone living in a city so basically one day we might have some guidelines for how to make cities is more livable and healthier through the process of inhalation of air nutrients and though we all know about healthy balanced diet soon we might also start hearing about healthy Aeron nutrient diet assuming of course the study kicks off some kind of a research that leads to some breakthroughs and some major discoveries but I guess until then

L05idkJdyzs,11:13,en,true,true,ok,,so one of the questions a lot of us have been asking since the launch of james webb telescope is how exactly is it going to handle the collisions with various micrometeorites especially because it's going to be staying in space without any ability to repair this telescope for several years and very likely up to several decades or at least one decade in other words the question is what happens when one of the micrometeorites strikes the mirrors or hits some other essential part of the telescope is the mission going to be over well obviously the answer to that question is no but there is a more specific answer to this that we're going to be talking about in this video because as you might have heard already it just happened a slightly larger than average micrometeorite officially hit one of the main mirrors on the telescope but what you might have not heard yet is that this is not the first time it happened since the launch this is actually the fifth time it happened and the first four collisions were not really that major and so in this video i wanted to talk a little bit more about the details behind what happened what all of this means and more importantly what we know about these micro collisions or micrometeorite collisions from the previous import missions such as hubble which as you can probably imagine received so many more collisions over the period of about 30 years and this is exactly where we're going to start the iconic hubble telescope the telescope that changed everything and you might already be aware that in the beginning when the hubble just started operating nasa performed several so-called hubble servicing missions in order to replace some of the parts on the telescope that were either aging or were outdated or maybe even broken and as they were doing so they actually ended up bringing some of the parts back to planet earth to be studied in more detail and even in the first few years of its existence when the space around the planet was not really that crowded yet hubble has already accumulated quite a lot of different impact craters from various collisions so for example in 1993 approximately three years after the original launch these solar panels here had to be replaced because of the unusual temperature fluctuation they were causing to the telescope and the fun fact is that the solar panels were the contribution from the european space agency and were actually then returned to the esa for further study once they were retrieved from the hubble telescope and this was actually the first opportunity in history of space exploration to see the kind of impacts that would occur on any spacecraft after about two years orbiting planet earth and here they found hundreds of impact craters on just a small section of the solar array some of them were extremely tiny only microns in size but some of them were relatively large approximately several millimeters then nine years later solar panels were replaced yet again returned to planet earth and once again even more impact craters were found here as well this particular solar panel is actually on the display in the netherlands inside the esa's technology center known as aztec but in this case the scientists also wanted to find out where exactly the impact craters came from was it from micrometeorites was it from some kind of a human-made debris or was it from something else entirely in other words they also decided to conduct a chemical analysis on every single one of these collisions and they did so by looking at whatever was unusual present inside the impact craters that should not have been there and that probably came from something else and so for a lot of these impact craters the fragments inside were from micrometeorites it was because of things like iron and nickel but some of them also contained aluminum and oxygen which very likely came from human activity essentially from various solid rocket motors or from various space debris and considering the amount of debris that's orbiting the planet it should not really come as a surprise and here the team even went as far as matching the shape and size of various craters to actual models of rockets that were responsible for producing the debris but obviously even after 30 years of the collisions here the hubble telescope is still operating and still producing all the imagery we have today in other words the scientists have definitively established that these collisions these micrometeorites even though they do cause occasional problems are not going to be causing any major faults in a telescope or are going to be the reason for the emission failure although they do cause a kind of a gradual degradation in the amount of power the solar panels can provide and also the gradual declination in the quality of images but in this case some of this can be actually restored with software although interestingly enough in the last decade or so the amount of debris has obviously increased dramatically and the chance for a collision has gone from approximately 0.15 chance per year to approximately 0.3 per day increasing by about 700 times okay but that's collisions on the hubble telescope what about james webb i mean we know that the solar panels should be okay over time but how about the other parts the shield or the telescope mirrors which in this case are directly exposed to open space well first of all we have to remember that because this particular telescope is not orbiting the planet but it's actually in the lagrange 2 point it's pretty far away from any human-made debris and because of this the chance of a collision here is pretty low overall on top of this in this region it's also not going to be receiving a lot of micrometeorites which usually tend to approach planet earth simply because it's the largest gravitational body in this area but more importantly these mirrors were specifically designed to withstand impacts from soundly smaller micrometeoroids although over time it's very likely that the appearance of these mirrors is going to become a little bit more rough reducing in the overall reflectivity and also becoming a little bit more rugged as well but for the first few years all these imperfections can be easily corrected digitally and also because when the mirrors were originally designed they were created to be even smoother than they should have been in other words the actual telescope does not have to be as perfect as it currently is it can still operate even if the mirrors are slightly scratched and so today the models suggest that it will probably take at least a few years before any of this becomes a significant problem and since the original launch a few months ago there have already been force more measurable micrometeoroid strikes with all of them directly meeting the expectations and the mathematical models however the most recent fifth collision was a little bit larger than the predictions and the original assumptions and so because of this the scientists behind the mission have to crunch a few numbers and develop future techniques for when this happens again at the moment though this is definitely not a problem and is not going to cause any issues for future observations and so in this case the mission is still a go and it's still going to be performing way beyond our expectations and the recent measurements just from a few days ago suggested that all the components on the telescope are still performing way beyond expectations and technically even exceed the original expectations the scientists had for this mission and since the telescope has already been in space for i guess half a year receiving only five collisions is actually good news it means that maybe this will be a lot less common than the scientists thought there's actually a really good article by nasa that you can find in the description below it sort of goes through very common questions about the resiliency of this telescope and how likely the mirrors are to survive a lot of different types of collisions from various micrometeorites with the scientists here even explaining different techniques that were used to test the mirrors and how everything on a telescope was engineered to withstand a lot of different types of damage and a lot of bombardment from various objects and one of the ways that all this will be done in the future when there's a lot of damage on the telescope is going to be by adjusting the position of certain segments and thus canceling out the portion of distortions coming from the damaged parts in other words there is a physical way in which the scientists are going to be able to try to counteract the damage to certain mirrors and this has already been done for the recently damaged segment known as c3 and when it comes to more dramatic events such as meteor showers the team in this case can also prevent the further damage by conducting certain protective maneuvers so for example by turning the optics away from known meteor showers before they occur although the most recent collision was not from a meteor shower it was one of those events that just happens by chance and one of the other things that the scientists are hoping to learn from all of this is actually in regards to these collisions by keeping the james webb telescope in this position for several years it sort of turns the telescope into a kind of a highly sensitive detector of various micrometeorites which can also help us learn a little bit more about the micrometeorite condition in these environments and also teach us a little bit more about the collisions as we become interplanetary species and as we start launching missions to for example mars and so it will definitely help the scientists measure the overall effect of micrometeorite collisions for various other objects and various other telescopes especially in the region known as the lagrange two points something that has never really been measured before by previous missions and so at least for now that's kind of all we know we know that the james webb seems to be operating normally we know that it's going to be releasing its first images on july 12th and we also know that the mission seems to be a go and nothing seems to be broken and will probably stay normal for many years to come in this case the entire telescope was definitely engineered and designed to withstand a lot of different damage but once more news comes out on once we'll learn something else i'll make sure to fold this up in another video until then thank you for watching subscribe maybe share this video with someone who loves learning about space and sciences and maybe come back tomorrow

Zrv1EDIqHkY,31:33,en,false,true,ok,,"- This is a video about the oldest unsolved problem in math that dates back 2000 years. Some of the brightest mathematicians of all time have tried to crack it, but all of them failed. In the year 2000 the Italian mathematician, Piergiorgio Odifreddi, listed it among four of the most pressing open problems at the time. Solving this problem could be as simple as finding a single number. So mathematicians have used computers and checked numbers up to 10 to the power of 2,200, but so far they've come up empty handed. Why do you think this problem has captured the imaginations of so many mathematicians? - It's old, it's simple, it's beautiful. - What else could you want? So the problem is this. Do any odd perfect numbers exist? So what is a perfect number? Well take the number six for example. You can divide it by 1, 2, 3, and 6, but let's ignore 6 because that's the number itself, and now we're left with just the proper divisors. If you add them all up, you find that they add to six, which is the number itself. So numbers like this are called perfect. You can also try this with other numbers like 10. 10 has the proper divisors one, two, and five. If you add those up, you only get eight. So 10 is not a perfect number. Now you can repeat this for all other numbers, and what you find is that most numbers either overshoot or undershoot between 1 and a 100, only 6 and 28 are perfect numbers. Go up to 10,000 and you find the next two perfect numbers 496 and 8,128. These were the only perfect numbers known by the ancient Greeks, and they would be the only known ones for over a thousand years. If only we could find a pattern that makes these numbers, then we could use that to predict more of them. So what do these numbers have in common? Well, one thing to notice is that each next perfect number is one digit longer than the number that came before it. Another thing they share is that the ending digit alternates between 6 and 8, which also means they are all even. But here's where things get really weird. You can write 6 as the sum of 1 plus 2 plus 3 and 28 as the sum of one, plus 2, plus 3, plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7, and so on for the others as well, they're all just the sum of consecutive numbers and you can think of each additional number as adding a new layer. And so these create a triangle, which is why these numbers are called triangular numbers. Also, every number except for six is the sum of consecutive odd cubes. So 28 is 1 cubed plus 3 cubed. 496 is equal to 1 cubed plus 3 cubed plus 5 cubed plus 7 cubed. And 8,128 is equal to 1 cubed plus 3 cubed plus 5 cubed plus 7 cubed plus 9 cubed all the way up to 15 cubed. But here's the one that really blows my mind. If you write these numbers in binary, six becomes 110, and 28 becomes 11100. 496 becomes 111110000. And 8,128, you guessed it. It is also a string of ones followed by a series of zeros. So if you write them out, they are all just consecutive powers of two. What now around 300 BC Euclid was actually thinking along similar lines when he discovered the pattern that makes these perfect numbers. Take the number one and double it, you get two now, keep doubling it. You get 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. Now starting from one, add the next number to it. So 1 plus 2 equals 3. If that adds up to a prime, then you multiply it by the last number in the sequence to get a perfect number. So two times three equals six, the first perfect number. Now let's keep doing this. Add 1 plus 2 plus 4, and you get 7, which is again prime. So multiply it by the last number four, and you get 28. The next perfect number. Next, add 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 equals 15, but 15 isn't prime, so we continue add 16 to get 31, this is prime. So you multiply it by 16 and you get 496. The third perfect number. Now you can keep doing this to find bigger and bigger perfect numbers, and using this we can rewrite the first three. So 6 equals 1 plus 2 times 2 to the power of 1 and 28 equals 1 plus 2 plus 4 times 2 squared and 496 equals 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 plus 16 times 2 to the power of 4 where the first term is prime. But there's a more convenient way to write this still. Take any sum of consecutive powers of 2. So 2 to the power of zero which is 1 plus 2 to the 1 plus 2 to the 2, all the way up to 2 to the n minus 1. And now because you don't know n, you don't know what that is equal to, but it will be equal to something. So let's call that T. Now multiply this whole equation by two. So you get 2 to the 1 plus 2 to the 2, all the way up to 2 to the n, and this is equal to 2T. If you now subtract the first equation from the second, almost all the terms will cancel out and you're left with T equals 2 to the n minus 1. So you can replace this whole series with one less than the next power of 2. So six becomes 2 squared minus 1 times 2 to the 1. 28 becomes 2 cubed minus 1 times 2 squared, and 496 becomes 2 to the 5 minus 1 times 2 to the 4. Do you see the pattern? This number is always one more than this. So if we call this P, then Euclid formula that gives a perfect number is 2 to the P minus 1 times 2 to the P minus 1 whenever this is prime. Now, because you're multiplying it by 2 to the P minus 1, which is even, this will always give an even number. Euclid had found a way to generate even perfect numbers, but he didn't prove that this was the only way. So there could be other ways to get perfect numbers, including potentially ones that are odd. 400 years later, the Greek philosopher nicomchaus published Introdutio Arithmetica, the standard arithmetic text for the next thousand years. In it, he stated five conjectures statements he believed to be true, but did not bother actually trying to prove. His conjectures were one, the nth perfect number has n digits. Two, all perfect numbers are even. Three, all perfect numbers end in 6 and 8 alternately. Four, Euclid algorithm produces every even perfect number. And five, there are infinitely many perfect numbers. For the next thousand years no one could prove or disprove any of these conjectures, and they were considered facts. But in the 13th century, Egyptian mathematician Ibn Fallus published a list with 10 perfect numbers and their values of P. Three of these perfect numbers turned out not to be perfect at all. But the remaining ones are. The fifth perfect number is eight digits long, which disproves Nicomachus's first conjecture. And the next thing to notice is that both the fifth and sixth perfect number end in a 6. So that disproves Nicomachus's third conjecture that all perfect numbers end in a 6 or 8 alternately. Two conjectures were proven false. But what about the other three? Two centuries later, the problem reached Renaissance Europe where they rediscovered the fifth, sixth, and seventh perfect numbers. So far every perfect number had Euclid's form. And the best way to find new ones was by finding the values of P that make 2 to the P minus 1 prime. So French polymath Marin Mersenne extensively studied numbers of this form. In 1644, he published his in a book including a list of 11 values of P for which he claimed they corresponded to primes. Numbers for which this is true are now called Mersenne Primes. Of his list the first seven exponents of P do result in primes and they correspond to the first seven perfect numbers. But for some of the larger numbers like 2 to the 67 minus 1, Mersenne admitted to not even checking whether they were prime. ""To tell if a given number of 15 to 20 digits is prime or not all time would not suffice for the test."" Mersenne discussed the problem of perfect numbers with other luminaries of the time, including Pierre de Fermat and Rene Descartes. In 1638, Descartes wrote to Mersenne, I think I can show that there are no even perfect numbers except those of Euclid. He also believed that if an odd perfect number does exist, it must have a special form. It must be the product of a prime and the square of a different number. If he was right, these would easily have been the biggest breakthroughs on the problem since Euclid 2000 years earlier. But Descartes couldn't prove either of those statements. Instead, he wrote ""As for me, I judge that one can find real odd perfect numbers. But whatever method you use, it takes a long time to look for these."" Around a hundred years later at the St. petersburg Academy, the Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach met a 20-year-old math prodigy. The two stayed in touch corresponding by mail, and in 1729, Goldbach introduced this young man to the work of Fermat. At first, he seemed indifferent, but after a little more prodding by Goldbach he became passionate about number theory and he spent the next 40 years working on different problems in the field among them was the problem of perfect numbers. This Prodigy's name was Leonhard Euler. Euler picked up where Descartes had left off, but with more success. In doing so, he made three breakthroughs on this problem. First in 1732, he discovered the eighth perfect number, which he had done by verifying that 2 to the 31 minus 1 is prime. Just as Mersenne had predicted. For his other two breakthroughs, he invented a new weapon, the sigma function. All this function does is it takes all the divisors of a number, including the number itself and adds them up. So take any number, say six, sum up all its divisors and you get 12, which is twice the number we started with. And this will be true for all perfect numbers. The Sigma function of a perfect number will always give twice the number itself because the sigma function includes the number as one of its divisors. Now this may seem like a small change, but it ends up being extremely powerful. So let's look at a few examples. Take a prime number like seven. Now, because it's prime, you can't rearrange it into a rectangle, therefore the only divisors are one and the prime itself. So Sigma seven is 1 plus 7, which is equal to 8. Now, to keep things easier to follow, we'll just stick to the numbers. But what if instead of seven, you had seven cubed? Well, again, the sum of the divisors is really simple. It's just 1 plus 7 plus 7 squared plus 7 cubed. Now let's use it on a different number, say 20. The sum of its divisors is 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 5 plus 10 plus 20, which equals 42. But you can also write this as 1 plus 2 plus 4 times 1 plus 5. And this is what really makes the sigma function so powerful. If you have a number that is made up of other numbers that don't share factors with each other, then you can split up the sigma function into the sigma functions of the prime powers that make it up. So sigma of 2 squared times sigma 5 is equal to sigma 20. And since any number can be written as the product of prime powers, you can split up the sigma function of any composite number into the sigma functions of its prime powers. With his new function in hand, Euler achieved his second breakthrough and did what Descartes couldn't. He proved that every even perfect number has Euclid's form. This Euclid-Euler theorem solved a 1600-year-old problem and proved Nicomachus's fourth conjecture. Math historian William Dunham called it the greatest mathematical collaboration in history. But Euler wasn't finished yet. He also wanted to solve the problem of odd perfect numbers. So for his third breakthrough, he set out to prove Descartes other statement that every odd perfect number must have a specific form. Because if an odd perfect number does exist, you know two things first n is odd. And second sigma of n equals 2n. Now any number n, you can write as a product of different prime numbers and each prime can be to some power. So let's take that and put it into Euler sigma function. So you get sigma of n equals sigma of all of those primes to their powers, which equals 2n. But since all of these factors are primes, you can actually split up the sigma function into the sigmas of the individual prime powers. Now one thing to notice is that if you have a prime number raised to an odd power, for example seven to the power of 1, then the sigma function will be even because 1 plus 7 equals 8, you'll always get an even number because odd plus odd is even if the prime number is instead raised to an even power like seven squared, then the sigma function returns an odd number. Sigma of 7 squared equals 1 plus 7 plus 7 squared, which equals 57. Because odd plus odd plus odd equals odd. So if you have the sigma function of an odd prime raised to an odd power, it will give an even number. If instead it's raised to an even power, you get an odd number. And this is where Euler's genius insight comes in because here on the right side you've got 2 times n where n is an odd perfect number, and 2 is even. Well, what that means is that on the left side there must only be one even number because if there were two even numbers, you could factor out four. But that means you should also be able to factor out four on the right side, which you can't because n is odd and there's only a single 2 here. So only one of these sigmas here can give an even number, which means that there is exactly one prime that is to an odd power and all the others must be to an even power just as Descartes had predicted. Now, Euler refined the form a bit more and showed that an odd perfect number must satisfy this condition, but even Euler couldn't prove whether they existed or not. He wrote ""Whether there are any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question."" For the next 150 years very little progress was made and no new perfect numbers were discovered. English mathematician Peter Barlow wrote that Euler eighth perfect number ""Is the greatest that ever will be discovered for as they are merely curious without being useful, it is not likely that any person will ever attempt to find one beyond it."" But Barlow was wrong. Mathematicians kept pursuing these elusive perfect numbers and most started with Mersenne's list of proposed primes. The next on his list was 2 to the 67 minus 1. So far, Mersenne had done an excellent job. He had included Euler's eighth perfect number while avoiding others like 29 that turned out not to lead to a perfect number, but 230 years after Mersenne published his list, Edouard Lucas proved that 2 to the 67 minus 1 was not prime, although he was unable to find its factors. 27 years later, Frank Nelson Cole gave a talk to the American mathematical society without saying a word, he walked to one side of the blackboard and wrote down 2 to the 67 minus 1 equals 147,573,952,589,676,412,927. He then walked to the other side of the blackboard and multiplied 193,707,721 times 761,838,257,287 giving the same answer. He sat down without saying a word and the audience erupted in applause. He later admitted it took him three years working on Sundays to solve this. A modern computer could solve this in less than a second. From 500 BC until 1952 people had discovered just 12 Mersenne primes and therefore only 12 perfect numbers. The main difficulty was checking whether large Mersenne numbers were actually prime. But in 1952, American mathematician Raphael Robinson wrote a computer program to perform this task and he ran it on the fastest computer at the time, the SWAC. Within 10 months, he found the next five Mersenne primes and so corresponding perfect numbers. And over the next 50 years, new Mersenne primes were discovered in rapid succession, all using computers. The largest Mersenne prime at the end of 1952 was 2 to the power of 2,281 minus 1, which is 687 digits long. By the end of 1994, the largest Mersenne prime was 2 to the power of 859,433 minus 1, which is 258,716 digits long. Since these numbers were getting so astronomically large, the task of finding numerous end primes became more and more difficult even for supercomputers. So in 1996, computer scientist George Woltman launched the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search or GIMPS. GIMPS distributes the work over many computers allowing anyone to volunteer their computer power to help search for Mersenne primes. The project has been highly successful so far, having discovered 17 new Mersenne primes, 15 of which were the largest known primes at that time. And the best part, if your computer discovers a new Mersenne prime, you'll be listed as its discoverer, adding yourself to a list that includes some of the best mathematicians of all time. There's even a $250,000 prize for the first billion-digit prime. In 2017 Church Deacon John Pace discovered the 50th Mersenne Prime by using GIMPS. The number 2 to the 77,232,917 minus 1 is more than 23 million digits long, and it was also the largest known prime at the time. To celebrate this achievement the Japanese publishing house, Nanairosha published this book, ""The Largest Prime number of 2017."" And all it is is that number spread over 719 glorious pages. It's wild. The size of this font is so tiny. The book quickly rose to the number one spot on Amazon and sold out in four days. A year later, the 51st Mersenne Prime was discovered. It's 2 to the 82,589,933 minus 1, and this number has 24,000,860 2048 digits. But there's something I enjoy about the absurdity, like there is knowledge in here, but it's not the kind of knowledge that anyone's ever gonna read out of a book. But in some way it's nice that there's this physical artifact that like has the number, if ever we lost all the prime numbers. You know, someone could find this book be like, here's the big one. As of today, this is still the largest known prime. And since numbers of this form grow so rapidly, the largest Mersenne Prime is almost always the largest known prime. Computers have been incredibly successful at finding new Mersenne primes and their corresponding perfect numbers, but we've still only found 51 so far. So you might suspect that there are only a finite number of them, which would mean that Nicomachus's fifth conjecture would be false, that there aren't infinitely many perfect numbers, but that might not be the case. The Lenstra and Pomerance Wagstaff conjecture predicts how many Mersenne primes should appear based on how large P is. Now this is the actual data the conjecture performs remarkably well. But more importantly, it predicts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and so infinitely many even perfect numbers. The Mersenne primes are just so large and rare that they take a lot of time and computer resources to find. But a conjecture is not a proof. And up until this day, this problem shares the title of oldest unsolved problem in math with the other open problem. Do any odd perfect numbers exist? The easiest way to solve this problem is by finding an example. So maybe we could just check different odd numbers and see if one of them is perfect. That's exactly what researchers tried in 1991. By using a smart algorithm called a factor chain, they were able to show that if an odd perfect number does exist, it must be larger than 10 to the power of 300. 21 years later, Pascal Ochem and Michael Rao raised that lower bound to 10 to the 1,500 with recent progress pushing that number up to 10 to the 2,200. With numbers that large, it's unlikely that a computer will find one anytime soon. So we'll need to get smart. What would a proof look like? Like how could we actually prove this? - I think the main idea that people have been trying to approach this problem with is coming up with more and more conditions odd perfect numbers have to satisfy, it's called this web of conditions where it has to have 10 prime factors now that we know and maybe thousands of non distinct prime factors and has to be bigger than 10 to the 3000. And it has to do all these different things and we hope that eventually there's just so many conditions that can strain the numbers so much that they can't exist. - Since Euler, mathematicians have kept adding new conditions to this web. - But so far it hasn't worked. - But there might be another path. When Descartes was looking for odd perfect numbers, he came across 198,585,576,189, which you can factor as 3 squared times 7 squared times 11 squared times 13 squared times 22021. Put this into Euler sigma function and you find it is equal to two times the original number. In other words, it is perfect. That is if 22021 were prime, but it's not because it is equal to 19 squared times 61. And filling that in shows that it is not perfect. Numbers like this that are very close to being odd perfect numbers are called spoofs. Spoofs are a larger group of numbers. So odd perfect numbers share all properties of spoofs and then a few extra ones. And the goal is to find properties of spoofs that ultimately prevent them from being odd perfect numbers. For example, one condition of odd perfect numbers is that they can't be divided by 105. So if you find that spoofs must be divisible by 105, then this would prove that odd perfect numbers can't exist. In 2022 Pace Nielsen and a team at BYU found 21 spoof numbers including Descartes number, and while they discovered some new properties of spoofs, they didn't find any that rule out odd, perfect numbers. So how large would an odd perfect number have to be? - They don't exist. - You don't think odd perfect numbers exist? - No, they don't exist. I wish they did. That'd be really cool if if there was just this one gigantic odd, perfect number out in the universe. They don't exist. No. - How are you convinced that they don't exist? - There is something called a heuristic argument where it's not a proof. So if we had a proof, we'd be done. It's just an argument from, okay, we think primes occur this often of this type. And you put that those pieces of information together and you think, okay, on average how many numbers should be perfect. - This argument, which was made by Carl Pomerance predicts that between 10 to the 2,200 and infinity, there are no more than 10 to the negative 540 perfect numbers of the form N equals pm squared - With odd perfect numbers the heuristic says we shouldn't expect any. We've searched high enough now that we think we have enough evidence they shouldn't exist anymore. - My understanding is this heuristic argument. It also predicts that there are no large perfect numbers even or odd. So... That's true. So there's a downside. Yeah, there's a downside because it says there shouldn't be large, even perfect numbers and we actually expect there to be infinitely many. And so, okay, so... why do I believe the heuristic in this case and not this case? You're right. Am I being hypocritical about that? There are other aspects you can add on to the heuristic and make it stronger. Let me put it that way. But you're right, it's not a proof. - For now this is still the oldest unsolved problem in math. Euler was right when he said whether there are any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question. So are there any applications of this problem? - I can say no. - Now, many people may think that if there are no applications to the real world, then there's no point studying it. Why should anyone care about some old unsolved problem? But I think that's the wrong approach. For more than 2000 years, number theory had no real world applications. It was just mathematicians following their curiosity and solving problems they found interesting proving one result after another and building a foundation of useless mathematics. But then in the 20th century, we realized that we could take this foundation and base our cryptography on it. This is what protects everything from text messages to government secrets. - Whenever you have a group of people put their minds towards a problem, something good's gonna come out of it. If it's only, if it's only at the beginning, this doesn't work. Okay, well, as Edison said, I learned 999 ways of not making a light bulb. Eventually I got a good way to do it. It's the same with math. You have a problem and you throw your mind at it and others do too. And you come up with new ideas and eventually something good comes from that process. - Einstein's general relativity was built on non-Euclidean geometries, geometries that were developed as intellectual curiosities without foresight of how they would one day change the way we understand the universe. How many people do you think are working on the problem of perfect numbers right now? - I'd guess around 10 people currently have papers in the area, 10 to 15. If you're a high schooler and you just love mathematics and you think, I want a problem to think about, this one's a great problem to think about. And you can make progress. You can figure out new things. Yeah, don't be scared. Hundreds of people have thought about this problem for thousands of years. What can I do? You can do something. - Why should you do math if you don't know that it will lead anywhere? Well, because doing the math is the only way to know for sure. You can't tell in advance what the outcome will be. Like this problem might turn out to be a dud. We might solve it and it might not mean anything to anyone, or it could turn out to be remarkably helpful. The only way to know for sure is to try In today's world, it often feels like you've gotta choose between following your curiosity and building real skills you can apply.

QX_2sLdHN5k,12:33,en,true,true,ok,,"today I wanted to discuss a very unusual impact event that happened on the planet 2.5 million years ago that might have been responsible for transforming the planet by initiating what's known as the ice age but before we discuss the details I actually have to start with how we know all of this and how all of this was discovered and it actually starts with this vessel you see right here usns IL tannan a former US Navy ship that became reclassified as a scientific vessel and in 1964 became an Antarctic research vessel and started to collect a lot of sample cores from the ocean floor while also photographing the seabed back then and actually for decades afterwards this particular Mission became unusually popular because of this picture the photo of what became known as the alanian antenna a very bizarre structure at a depth of 3900 M or 13,000 ft that because of its anural shape was almost instantly linked to a lot of UFO related theories and strangely enough it wasn't actually until 2003 that actual marine biologists saw this picture and were able to definitively identify what this was and well you see it right here a type of a caruous sponge known as chundra gladia concrescence with a much more common name ping pong tree sponge something that was actually discovered all over the place but something that's still very mysterious because of the depths where we usually find these deep sea organisms but because this mission was also physically collecting samples from the C4 as well at some point some of these sedimental samples became analyzed as well and it turns out that an intriguing study came out announcing that they discovered an unusual iridium anomaly in one of the seore samples known as e13 D3 this one was discovered at a depth of 5,000 m and seemed to contain way too much iridium for all of this to be natural or for all of this to come from planet Earth and the analysis of Isotopes eventually matched this to a lot of different kritic meteorites but the question is what exactly was it doing so deep and how exactly did any of this get there and while within a few years by 1988 the researchers proposed an intriguing hypothesis in this study by Frank kite in his team they actually discovered even more evidence and more Isotopes in a really large area across 600 km of the southeast pafic sea floor suggesting that this was a sign of a huge impact with the size of the asteroid been at least 500 M or3 Mi with the follow-up expedition in 1995 collecting more samples and establishing the date to be approximately 2.1 million years ago so approximately 400,000 years since the beginning of quinary or essentially since the beginning of ice ages but around the same time scientists studing various deposits in Antartica and also scientist studing deposits in places like Chile in South America started to actually discover completely different science from what seemed to be an ancient mega tsunami a tsunami that seems to have traveled from the point you see right here and seems to have affected a lot of different regions around the same time here it seemed to be coming from waves up to 100 m me high all coming from the same location somewhere Southwest of South America and more importantly it suggested that the initial wave was probably several hundred m in height possibly even up to 1 km here we had signs from places like Antartica Chile Australia and New Zealand with the evidence pointing at the same phenomenon a really large tsunami wave generated by something very powerful but the date here did not really add up this particular tsunami seems to have happened a little bit earlier and well this led to another Expedition the one in 2001 that once again reanalyzed everything discovering that all of this idium was actually deposited to 2.5 million years ago plusus 70,000 years and this matched the tsunami with further computer simulations discovering that it was most likely caused by the asteroid at least 1 km in size but possibly up to 4 km in size striking the planet at 40 km/s but most importantly hitting very deep ocean right here and that's what makes this particular impact so unique this is the only known asteroid impact in the Deep ocean it left no crater but it left signs of impact all over the place with the first signs discovered by El tanan or maybe alanin I guess I keep mispronouncing it but basically because of this this is now known as the alanan impact the most powerful recent impact equivalent to approximately 100 billion to possibly even 10 trillion tons of TNT which is by the way hundreds of times more than all of the nuclear bombs combined on the planet exploring all at once and depositing fragments of region 660x 200 km in size and that's of course those samples collected earlier where we definitely see signs of idium but we also see signs of mixing of melted ejector with seawater salts which can only be explained by a powerful explosion caused by a powerful impact mostly because seaflo here is at least 3 km deep but based on the evidence and obviously based on the simulations we don't think this impactor ever reached the seafloor it basically evaporated and exploded by hitting the water at extremely fast velocities which of course means that it also ejected an enormous amount of material into the atmosphere huge amounts of water vapor but also sea salts sulfur and a lot of dust that came from the asteroid itself with all of this stuff remaining in the atmosphere for at least 2 years possibly much longer and so this of course leads us to this main proposition today a lot of scientists believe that this impactor was potentially the last straw that essentially initiated the Ice Age more officially known as the quaternary glaciation or place to se glaciation in essence a series of different glaciation and interation periods that shifts between the period of extended ice sheets during which the sea levels usually drop and enormous ice sheets form in the north hemisphere with Antarctica expanding in the Southern Hemisphere and the intercial period when the the overall climate is much warmer the sea levels are much higher with the whole planet transforming in a lot of different ways as well for example during the last S period which was approximately 125,000 years ago apparently various forests were able to reach all the way to North of Norway where today we basically have almost nothing and back then the sea levels were at least 6 to 9 M higher and the average temperature was about 2Â° C higher as well and so this unusual illation between glacial and interglacial periods has now been happening for 2 and2 million years but 2.6 million years ago Earth was not actually doing this and looked a lot different as well or at least different in certain locations here it was at least 3Â° warmer and so the sea levels were 30 m higher and back then Antarctica was much warmer as well with the eye sheets barely present and usually only appearing in the winter and though the Earth was slowly cooling down it did not go to these unusual glaciation periods and so something must have happened 2.5 million years ago to transform everything and to trigger these unusual events now the actual answer is potentially super complex and very likely involves play tectonics changes in ocean currents and possibly milanich Cycles but there must have been at least one main trigger and just like with the extinction of dinosaurs that trigger was potentially an asteroid and today we have a lot of a that it was indeed this alanian asteroid that only left very minor signs in the depths of the Pacific Ocean and on the shores of Antarctica South America Australia and New Zealand and so following this impact which very likely dramatically shifted the climate the eyce sheets suddenly started to appear because the albo or reflectivity of the planet was suddenly enhanced dramatically due to all of the sulfur released by the impact while at the same time all of the dust in the atmosphere which also came from the asteroid very likely made the days much darker and thus lowered the temperature even more and so here within just two years the temperatures very likely dropped dramatically most likely initiating the first glaciation period And it very likely had other effects as well possibly depletion of ozone lay possibly acidification of the oceans which by the way we know happened during the dinosaur extinction event and you can learn about this in one of the previous videos in the description and because of all of these effects it might have had some kind of a localized Extinction that we just don't really know much about but it was this impact that most likely led to the first glaciation and the first extended ice sheets in the northern hemisphere but I guess what's really unusual and somewhat difficult to explain is why is it that the ice ages are still going on technically the impact should have stopped the Ice Age once the planet warmed up just like it did previously with the chulu event 66 million years ago but for some reason the glaciation that happened 2.6 million years ago essentially turned into a repetitive cycle that's still going on today and will most likely repeat again in the next 40,000 years and so here even though we do have evidence for what potentially started the Ice Age we have no idea why it's not stopping unless of course this hypothesis is maybe not complete or completely incorrect maybe this impact actually played a very small role or possibly no role at all and maybe the fact that it happened around the same time when the ice ages started was just basically some kind of a coincidence nevertheless this is still a super intriguing event that we unfortunately know so little about mostly because it's kind of difficult to study this since most of the evidence is on the bottom of the ocean and it's an intriguing event because it produced one of the biggest tsunamis ever with actual signs in a lot of different locations but at least for now that's I guess all I wanted to discuss once there are new studies or new discoveries we'll come back and talk more about this in some the future videos until then check out some of the studies and some of the other links in the description

XdfXe9Te-pY,13:57,en,true,true,ok,,"so here I was doing a little bit of research on planet 9 and trying to find out if there are possibly other solar systems that have a somewhat similar structure with a relatively large planet on the outskirts of the main solar system and to my surprise I've discovered an article about a planet that is ridiculously large and ridiculously far away from its um primary star and that particular solar system is apparently the biggest solar system in our galaxy welcome to what the maath and let's talk about this solar [Music] system and to my surprise I was also able to find uh that system in space engine which we'll be using near the end of the video where we're going to explore that particular uh system in more detail but let's actually do this in Universe Sandbox first we're going to go into the normal solar system here and I'm going to show you how big that solar system is now it has a funny name its name is Tass J 2126 8140 unfortunately though this system or its star or its um Planet are not in uh Universe Sandbox it hasn't been added to um their catalog yet because it ends at 21 uh 1 and doesn't have 212 so that's okay we're going to create a manual um version of this particular system using our own Sun so here is Sun here's Earth this is one astronomical unit and let me just show you how large this system would be and essentially what they've discovered is so there's a central star uh very similar to our sun and relatively far away from it I'm going to have to use edit here uh at a distance of on average about 4500 astronomical units which is close to 5,000 times more than um the distance from our sun to our planet Earth there is a very very large gas giant and look at how much I have to zoom out here first there we go just place it around 5,000 astronomical units uh there's another star here and this star uh sorry not star there's another planet here and this planet is called two Mass J 2126 8140 and this is kind of what it looks like in the game so it's sort of um a gas giant that's about to become a brown dwarf that may one day uh or would have one day become a star if he had more mass but it just didn't have enough mass and so it stayed as a very very hot gas giant and when it was originally found um it actually had a different name as a matter of fact the scientists thought that this was a brown dwarf it turns out that it's not um and uh when they've originally found it it was classified as a brown dwarf until they realized it was actually moving exactly in the same direction and in exactly the same way as its parent star and so they had to then rename this to um to basically give it a a planetary classification because they realized this was actually the the largest possible solar system that we've found so far and uh the radius right here is about 5,000 chmical units which is about 7% of one lightyear so it's it's pretty far uh not I guess not as far as as as a near star to us which is four light years four four and and point2 light years um but it it is pretty pretty far nevertheless and one orbit around this star would take this planet about um 1 million years so yeah I'm sorry I keep calling it star but it's not really a star it's actually it is a very large gas giant and and so the temperature of um of this particular planet is close to 2,000 de C it's about uh 10 to 15 times mass of Jupiter and if I were to place Jupiter next to it this is what it would look like so it's in terms of size it's not much bigger than Jupiter but it definitely is a lot more massive and um it definitely might even have a very large sort of um Moon system around it it um which is what we're going to be exploring in space engine uh near the end of the video and what's really interesting about this particular system is that now we actually realize that uh Stars can actually form in different ways not just in how we usually imagine them forming from one sort of a disc of spinning material where certain things become planets certain things become uh moons and then certain things become uh the star essentially but here the new proposition is that there was very likely have been sort of like a cloud of gas in this region and a cloud of gas in this region that sort of uh coales into a star with planets and a gas giant with its own Moon so they actually were almost like a binary system except this never became a star and they were relatively far away from each other so here what would happen um if a star if another star came into um sort of vicinity of the system um unfortunately this this planet would lose its orbit so I'm going to demonstrate this by just launching a random main sequence star through this area right here I just launch it somewhere I don't know just here and here we go so if if this actually passes by relatively close to them uh the orbit of two Mass J 2126 would actually be disturb enough for it to lose its um orbital path and there you go this you can see orbit already changing and then eventually just kind of Fly Away into the other door [Music] system and interestingly it actually got Disturbed at first and almost lost its orbit and then it reestablished it so I guess um there's still a chance that it it may have had some sort of a close encounter with other stars and didn't really Escape uh but what what's really important to understand here is that it may have been formed in a very um relatively empty environment so other stars couldn't disturb these two and that its orbit is relatively weak so if I were to do this again let's just do this for fun one more time we're going to launch another random main sequence star going somewhere here and it's going relatively fast I should probably slow down a little bit let's slow down to 500 kilm per second and here we go so it's passing it's going to pass relatively close to uh the planet here and it's very likely is going to disturb its orbit uh to the point where it might actually escape and so there you go um so yeah there's H quite a lot of really cool theories that might form as a result of uh this discovery uh mostly in in relation to how our solar systems are formed and look at that it's reestablished the orbit again it's been really stubborn which is pretty cool I guess anyway so um what I wanted to basically talk about is the idea of us really not knowing that much about um how some Stars may actually form we have a lot of um hypotheses we have a lot of speculations but um now that we've found this really interesting system that has a planet so so so so far away uh first of all it suggests that uh yes Planet 9 might be a reality because we don't really exactly know how some planets might might form um and the other thing is that uh so there's actually quite a lot of different ways for solar systems to form and let's actually go into space engine and explore this particular uh planet or I guess you could call it on almost brown dwarf because in space engine it has some really cool planets around it and so if you go to space engine and you start typing two mass and then basically uh what you I think you you have to type is 2126 uh you will find there's only one uh star that um meets this classification and it's this star right here go to it and that's essentially what uh that planet is that what I was talking about unfortunately since this is a little bit outdated here it's still classified as a brown DF which which is what it was up until 2016 and 2016 we've realized that this is actually not a brown dwarf this is just a very large gas giant uh the mass here is a little bit larger than it should be here it's 23 masses of Jupiter in reality it's about closer to about 10 to 15 um or something close to about 40% mass of sun so it's it's relatively large but uh nevertheless it's not really a brown dwarf it is an exoplanet uh or planet outside of solar system and this particular exoplanet in space engine has its own system of moons and some which are actually really awesome I've already explored this a little bit but we're going to go and um land on some of them just to check them out so this here is a cool Oceania or a cool ocean world that check it out it looks relatively scary actually because it's kind of red and uninviting but essentially imagine being on this world and landing on this Moon that has these really really sort of dark red skies at all times this is what it would look like in a sky if you were to kind of land here and this is essentially an ocean I think I think that's an ocean um but this planet is this moon is relatively cold it's- 24Â° C so any water here would be obviously Frozen and anything else um like for example methane or any other um material would not actually be liquid just yet so it might not actually have any any actual oceans on it even though it's called Oceania the second one here is a cool or coold desert which is also pretty funny name uh- 148Â° c a pretty cool um Northern or Southern Lights or Aurora brial whatever you want to call it there um and once again this is a pretty red World very beautiful red World kind of reminiscent of Mars in the sense and what I really like about some of these desert worlds is that if you actually come really close to them you'll get to see all of the awesome procedurally generated detail that this game is famous for so the closer you get the more detail you get look at that we get almost get to see the sand grains so here we are we've landed on this really cool desert World um and so a lot of these are actually pretty interesting to explore and I'm I really like how uh this particular uh planet or exoplanet actually is not actually technically exoplanet yet so it's considered to be a star but because of this it's it has these various planets generated around it now we don't actually have the companion star or the main star here um unfortunately this star is not in the catalog for this game um but hopefully the developer will add it at some point because this was a pretty big Discovery in early 2016 so I'm sure he's going to edit it for sure now there's a few more Frozen worlds here um they kind of look very similar to the one I just showed you and so most of them basically look like darker and colder marsus uh and this one actually has a pretty interesting pattern on it almost looks like a picture of a man um but what I wanted to see is if there is also gas giants because I haven't explored all of these and I think there is actually no uh not going to be any gas giants here yeah so this is actually a pretty interesting and pretty accurate representation of what um this particular ex planet might have orbiting around it so all of these would be moons and um there will be quite a lot of them would be quite large so imagine just like our Jupiter has at least four major moons that we call Galilean moons this one seems to have six of them and they're all very large they're relatively cold and they would be um possibly quite dark as well because the only light they would be getting is from um the uh um the exoplanet itself and it doesn't actually meit that much light uh here it's a little bit larger so it Maks a little bit more light but since it's not technically even a brown dwarf it only really emits um large amounts of um infrared light which would uh make these planets relatively warmer than they would be otherwise but it wouldn't give them a lot of visual light so they would still be quite dark not even as bright as you see them here all right so I think that's all I wanted to show you in this particular video and I hope you enjoyed it so we're going to land on this oania once again and check out actually fly through these um Northern Lights as well and check out its surface one more time and um if you enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe if you still haven't and don't forget to share this video with someone who you think may enjoy Space videos as well like it if you liked it and look at this beauty holy cow this is actually worthy of a screenshot um and uh if you actually want to check out more of the videos uh related to space engine or Universe sbox 2 do check them out in the link that you see on the screen or in the description below and what I just realized is actually if I wait a little bit longer on the surface of this planet you'll notice that there's actually new effect here specifically look at that there's clouds in the sky this is such a beautiful view so this is what this Oceania looks like this is something I didn't expect to see while making this video this is incredibly beautiful so there's a almost like a sunset I guess I guess it's Sunset not really sunrise and you get to see the ocean floor here and then we can even go underwater I think yeah we can go a little bit underwater so there is some sort of a liquid I just don't really know what it is um because here it says we have atmosphere of carbon dioxide sulfur oxide and nitrogen but I don't think it's either one of these but anyway so that's essentially what I wanted to show you in this beautiful ending of this video and once again if you'd like to support this channel even more there's always the patreon page where you can possibly support me a little bit more so that I can actually make this channel even better even more interesting and produce more high quality videos anyway thank you so much guys I really appreciate all of your support I'll see you in the next video game you later and as always bye-bye"
8jnp005gHPU,11:22,en,true,true,ok,,hello and full person this is Anton and in this video we're going to discuss a discovery of an extremely unusual Galactic jet that currently does not make a lot of sense and that's because it's the largest Galactic jet we've ever discovered in some sense making this galaxy the largest discovered to date and you see the simulation of this Jet right here and though it's not easy to see how big this is it's actually 23 million light years from one end to the other and that's of course is the biggest such structure we've ever seen even bigger than the discovery we discussed only a couple of years ago in a galaxy referred to as Lon you can learn about this discovery in one of the previous videos in the description but before we talk about the recent discovery let's actually start with the mystery itself even today we still have no idea how these jets are produced okay we may we have some idea based on various simulations and based on very precise observations in x-rays infrared and radio light but these models do not explain some these unusual anomalies discovered in just the last few years especially because in many cases there's just way too much energy produced here with the material in these Jets moving extremely close to the speed of light and though the true mechanism is obviously unknown we do have basic understanding based on a lot of observations with radio telescopes for example the observations from the iconic Event Horizon telescope especially from some of the biggest and most powerful such black holes such as the one you see right here from the persus a definiely reveal extremely powerful magnetic fields based on a lot of polarization and these magnetic fields must be formed by very powerful acction discs and so as a lot of matter falls into the black hole and starts to form the accretion disc that orbits around it moving faster and faster and producing highly energetic interactions the closer to black holes they get this also results in the production of magnetic lines and that's because a lot of this inflowing matter is also magnetized eventually producing an extremely magnetic but also very compact disc but this disc becomes magnetically arrested in other words all of this magnetism is basically trapped and though these lines do become trapped inside the disc since the accretion disc spins around the black hole these lines also become entangled and So eventually these magnetic lines become so twisted and so entangled good that they basically snap overcoming the gravity hold of the black hole and it's this unusual snapping process that potentially produces these humongous and Powerful Jets but this is not a constant phenomenon and to some extent is more akin to a kind of a broken engine producing puffs of smoke once in a while which is kind of what we actually see if we do zoom in on these Jets and observe them in detail we don't really see a constant emission and instead we see a bunch of clouds moving at very high velocities and so the evidence from percus a the black hole that you see behind me provided enough evidence to explain all of this this black ho is speeding very fast it has an extremely magnetized environment which then results in relatively large Jets but not as large as the ones we're discussing today and it actually beats all of the previous record holders by a huge margin actually forming one of the biggest structures in the entire universe and a structure that's kind of difficult to explain and that's because when it comes to these radio galaxies or these extremely long radio Jets scientists always believed that there was a kind of a limit with a size limit basically being about 5 million light years mostly because with distance these Jets eventually fall apart as they start interacting with gas and a lot of additional material in the nearby Intergalactic space but Martin oi and his team accidentally discovered is somewhat difficult to detect but still definitely visible 20 3 million light year long Galactic jet this is the image produced in radio light and just for a comparison you can kind of see the Milky Way galaxy in the bottom right corner and though officially this galaxy has a relatively long name it's now also known as Peruan officially making this the largest known Galactic structure that beats the previous record holder oion that was actually discovered by um the same person and this was actually not the only such Discovery this was one of several different galaxies with really large Jets discovered by this team basically implying that this is not an anomaly and not an exception this actually seems to be a regular process that occurs in a lot of galaxies that once again kind of violates the modern cosmological ideas and obviously we still believe it's produced in a very similar way through the entanglement of powerful magnetic lines right now it's unclear why it doesn't fall apart even after 20 million White Years of travel and why it still appears to be kind of straight but one of the reasons we've never seen these galaxies before is because most of them are pretty far away this one is about 7 and A2 billion light years away from us when the universe was just half of its current age and because we're seeing this when the universe was much younger and thus a little bit thicker and a little bit denser it actually makes even less sense we technically expect much shorter jets in the much earlier Universe just because there is more gas and more matter to interact with and so to produce something very straight and very long you essentially need a lot of empty space and here the only explanation that makes sense and the one provided in a study involves the cosmic web the enormous structure and the enormous filament across the whole universe where basically most of the galaxies reside but between the filaments there are these Cosmic voids you can learn more about this concept in one of the videos in the description including the video about the so-called local void but in essence we know that this Cosmic web connects the entire universe and most galaxies especially very massive very powerful galaxies are usually summer at the crossroads and so it's possible that some of these jets are just pointed in such a way that instead of going into the cosmic web they basically go into the voids and so as long as the black hole is feeding constantly for at least several hundred million years or even a billion years like in this case it should have enough material to produce an enormous jet that's going to remain constant and straight As long as it's going through this void and the only reason this jet is stable and does not disip with distance is maybe because it's in that void although in reality right now this is actually one of the bigger Mysteries nobody knows how it's able to maintain its strength and how it's able to maintain its relatively straight profile but because this is not the first such Discovery it means that this is a relatively common phenomenon phenomenon that appears to be the result of really powerful magnetic fields and very powerful black ho emissions that produce just millions of light years in length way way above the official limits but naturally this also gives us just a little bit of a clue about the structure of the universe itself and so here the researchers believe that this jet is about 66% the total radius of the Void where this galaxy is located which first of all shows us how big these voids were when the universe was only about 6 and2 billion years old while also suggesting that these Jets maybe shape the cosmic web as well for example here the scientists believe that they're also responsible for a strange increase in temperature discovered in various voids Across the Universe and they can also explain certain magnetic interactions and certain magnetic fields that have been discovered inside voids as well so basically this could be coming from these massive Jets it just it's never really been seen until now and this of course means that this is maybe an extremely phenomenon that ends up enriching these voids and even changing their properties while also maybe affecting the cosmic web to some extent as well but because these are very recent discoveries and because a lot of this is actually still kind of difficult to see we're probably not going to know much more until future studies especially because this is really technically just the second such official detection and so until additional observations with even more powerful telescopes we're just not going to know much more but right now the implication is that these extremely powerful Jets very likely pump so many electrons and so many Atomic nuclei into the intergalactic medium that they actually end up dramatically changing the distribution of matter around the cosmic web possibly resulting in maybe different galaxies and different Stars being produced in certain regions now that's just an assumption for now but as you might have learned from one of the previous videos in description we know that powerful black ho and Powerful quers can actually dramatically shift everything around themselves even killing all galaxies within several million light years away you can learn about all of this in one of the videos in the description but when it comes to these powerful Jets or these unusually long structures we'll definitely come back and talk more about this most likely within the next few months

Pdg7WjDz8cA,11:27,en,true,true,ok,,about three years ago i made a lot of videos about this one phenomenon that back in 2019 gripped the world the phenomenon in regards to the star known as beetlejuice middle juice pirogeus say it three times and he appears behind you wait that's from another movie anyway you might already remember the story but back then the scientists were not sure what's actually happening to this iconic star one of the brightest stars in the night skies for some reason it started to dim with its overall brightness dropping by quite a large amount as a matter of fact the change was quite visible in a nice case if you knew where to look but then within a year by february of 2020 it stopped demon and started to brighten yet again and ever since then for approximately two years it more or less remained the same with some of the more recent observations using other frequencies such as infrared white determining that not much has actually changed around the star suggesting that it wasn't really going through some major changes on the inside and more importantly suggesting that it's definitely not going to go supernova as suggested by some of the media sources this was not going to happen for at least 10 000 years or possibly even longer and following several major observations in various frequencies and very thorough investigations by some of the best scientists around the planet it was more or less confirmed that what was happening to middle juice was very likely a result of a mid-remission from the surface that ended up creating a relatively large dust cloud with the dust cloud when released from the surface essentially blocking the star in just the right way which resulted in the overall demon effect and this is pretty much the explanation that everyone accepted it kind of made sense it also was supported by evidence from various telescopes and because beetlejuice has now been acting relatively normally there was absolutely no reason to suspect that it's going to go supernova or do anything else extremely unusual but there was still one question what exactly was this event what happened to beetlejuice three years ago to make this happen and i guess more importantly is it going to happen again can it happen again and that's exactly what the recent article from nasa tries to explore and it's actually by the relatively famous scientist who was actually the first to ever image the surface of this particular star using hubble telescope back in 1996. back then they were able to produce these beautiful images you see right here and were even able to resolve the first ever hot spots on the surface of another star other than our own sun and so the same scientists wanted to see what actually happened here and wanted to once again use hubble to investigate this and to try to resolve the mystery once and for all although in this case they didn't just use hubble they used several different observatories for example stellar robotic observatory in spain one of the telescopes in harvard and even one of the telescopes that's currently orbiting the sun known as stereo although in this case the data from the hubble telescope was actually the most beneficial and the one that was able to help us resolve this and well first of all and i guess that's the more important confirmation this star is not going to go supernova anytime soon the amount of mass lost from the star is completely insignificant compared to what we expect from a star that's about to go supernova but when compared to some of the more earthly terms the mass loss was actually pretty huge now in terms of the actual mass middle juice is at least 16 times the mass of our own sun it's also as you can see from this image not particularly spherical that's very common with these giant stars as a matter of fact there was a study not so long ago just a few months ago that sort of established that for these really really large stars it's generally relatively difficult to establish where their center is normally in astronomy to determine the center of the star the scientists will usually look for the center of brightness but for a typical red giant starlight beetlejuice the actual center of brightness the center of maximum luminosity tends to jump around or basically dance around and it actually kind of moves around everywhere it looks like this and so determining where the actual star is located and thus determining its distance becomes kind of problematic which basically suggests that these stars are just extremely active they're very unpredictable they're not particularly permanent in terms of shape and in terms of the actual activity on the surface and they're very dynamic they change all the time which is why here it does not look like a sphere and sort of resembles an unusual blob a blob that's not particularly dense either it's almost like some kind of a very large cloud of plasma rather than the actual star-like object but because this was such a bright star and a very well studied star and also a star with very predictable 400 day long pulsations that have been studied for nearly 300 years when suddenly the star experienced an unusual dimming effect and the pulsations also disappeared this definitely created one of the biggest mysteries in 2019 and is still technically the bigger mystery today as well beetlejuice by the way is somewhere right there is the orange that you see with this here showing us the iconic orion's belt and the orion nebula that you can see surrounding the belt and so the scientists behind this recent study really wanted to find out where did the pulsations go are they going to come back and what caused the unusual demon effect with all the observations in this case once again suggesting that the star lost a huge part of its visible surface resulting in the production what the scientists now call surface mass ejection or sme for short and obviously this is a type of behavior that's never been seen anywhere else before to some extent i guess it's comparable to the coronal mass ejections cmes around our own sun and that's of course when our sun does something like this throwing off a huge amount of mass from its surface but when comparing the numbers what happened around betelgeuse was about 400 billion times larger in terms of mass equivalent in mass to several times the mass of the moon and that's completely unimaginable by current standards that's something scientists believe that the stars could not actually do but looks like they can and when this chunk there was several masses of the moon in size left the surface of the star it very likely fractured a huge part of the photosphere of the star with the gas then cooling down to form a dust cloud that essentially blocked the light from the star as seen from planet earth with the dimming effects lasting for just a few months and this particular event the first such observed ever has also dramatically affected the star with beetlejuice still recovering from all of this even now for example various convection cells that are present inside the star which normally drive the pulsation and the circulation of material might have been disrupted by this event and are still sloshing around uncontrollably unable to produce regular pulsations that's of course why the regular pulsations are no longer visible and although the telescope observations suggest that the outer layers could already be back to normal the surface itself is still quite disturbed and is still bouncing around creating a lot of chaotic behavior and so it will probably take some time before the photosphere can reveal itself and before the star can return to be normal and i guess more importantly it also suggests that this is definitely not the same mechanism as the coronal message action it very likely has nothing to do with magnetic lines or magnetic fields and very likely was produced by something entirely different currently it's believed to be an entirely new phenomenon but the scientists now believe that it could have been caused by some kind of a convection plume several million miles or kilometers across that bubbled inside the star and produced this unusual expulsion of material or in other words it was some kind of a star bubble millions of kilometers in size but i guess more importantly this event shows us how these huge stars generally lose their mass and how they prepare themselves for the eventual supernova afterwards but how long the recovery stage is going to take before beetlejuice returns back to normal that's not the question we have the answer to but we might have an answer if the scientists are able to observe this in the infrared light by for example using jim's web telescope or by conducting additional observations in other frequencies as well because the dust here is only visible in the infrared light this might actually help the scientists see some of the previous eruptions if they ever happened and it might also help the scientists track where this gas is going and how this gas might evolve the nebula around it or maybe even determine how long video juice actually has before it explodes at the moment though because this is still an entirely new phenomenon and it's never been seen before around any other star out there all this is basically news to us still an exciting new observation and definitely a really important one because the evolution of these red stars is crucial to the evolution of the rest of the galaxy and since beetlejuice is such an iconic star anything that happens around it is also extremely intriguing and extremely important but i guess until we'll learn something else or until new discoveries that's pretty much all i wanted to mention we'll definitely talk more about beetlejuice and other red giants in some of the future videos for now though that's pretty much it check out all the relevant links

SzZinHsCfvE,7:51,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person this is Anton and in today's video we're going to be talking about the record holder for one of the farthest objects we've ever seen one of the oldest objects we've ever seen and also one of the brightest objects we've ever seen and you are seen on the screen right now this is an object known as ula s J 1342 today you're going to find out what it's all about and welcome to what the math so here's a hypothetical artist's impression of what we're actually looking at today we're looking at a quasar and the squeezer is the record holder as of 2018 for being the farthest objects we've ever detected now if you've ever used space engine you know that if you basically fly away from earth away from earth far far far far far away at a ridiculously high speed at some point you're going to reach the end of the universe now it is at this location in space where you can start finding these unusual objects known as quasars these are not just ancient basically they're pretty much the age of the universe maybe a little bit younger they're also ridiculously bright and I'm going to show it to you in the universe sandbox in a few seconds as soon as we reach the end of the universe now interestingly this particular object was only discovered in December of 2017 and it's unusual because we actually didn't think that it could be so ridiculously massive or at least a supermassive black hole at its center could be so massive it sort of puts a dent on our theory of creation of the universe because it is only about 5% the age of the universe basically it's only a few hundred million years and it seems that even then at this particular time they were already supermassive black holes that were ridiculously big now this right here is the edge of the visible universe and basically this is very very far away distance the comoving distance or I guess the total distance away from Earth right now is about 29 billion light-years because this was this object was moving away from us and because it was moving away from us at close to speed of light for basically 13 over 13 billion years it is now at a distance of almost 30 light years 30 billion light years away from us and this particular object is very similar to one of these galaxies here it's just a galaxy but in this case it is basically a very very young galaxy a 13-point wine 13.1 billion years ago when the galaxies were just still growing now what's interesting about this particular quasar that we've discovered is that it is just ridiculously bright indicating that right at the center there is a supermassive black hole that's about 800 million masses of our Sun which is once again about 200 times more massive than the one that we have in Milky Way in our own galaxy and this particular supermassive black hole is absorbing so much matter that it's just creating this ridiculously bright light that we can see from our own galaxy now let me just demonstrate to you what what all this looks like in your si box so imagine for a second that you are now in the middle in the center of this particular early early galaxies known as us J 1342 plus and 0 9 to 8 essentially this is an a black hole that's about 800 million times the mass of the Sun it is producing quite a lot of energy by absorbing a lot of matter and a lot of this matter is basically being first spun around a black hole but also then spit out in these two projections these two Jets that you see if i zoom out a little bit there you go those are the Jets you see now we're gonna zoom out of this until we barely see the galaxies so we're basically now at like distance of us - thats particular a quasar oh and by the way quasar is just a name or just a term for a galaxy with such a bright core or such a powerful black hole that it produces so much brightness that you can see it from far far away I'll actually explain this maybe two or three years ago in one of the videos you can check it out on the channel there's a there's quite a lot of terms like quasar blazer and a few other ones that I've mentioned this particular video and they are all kind of similar in what they represent now if I stare directly at this beam from a distance of 13 point one light billion lighters I will still see it and still going to be really really bright and this is what we're seeing we're seeing the actual beam pointing directly at us and because of the power of this beam you can see it from ridiculously far away distances and what's interesting is that this light has been traveling for so long that it started traveling during the early universe is right after what's known as the ionization epoch basically when universe turned from being computer neutral to actually start acquiring charge and because we discovered this unusual object as quasar we will now be able to actually use all of the data we study from this particular galaxy to try to basically show us and to teach us all about early universe and how universe advanced throughout the years so this is actually according to science at least and the goldmine of universe or the study of the universe and of course its history and its development there is however a small problem here and the problem is that this particular black hole right in the middle is too massive and we have no idea how and why it's so massive it doesn't really help us to try to explain in a way using the Big Bang Theory as a matter of fact it seems to actually support the so-called Big Bounce theory that suggests that there was really a kind of a big bang per se but it was more of a kind of a bounce so the universe contracted and then bounced back and started expanding again and so because of this we can kind of explain away the idea of having these supermassive black holes that would not be actually possible if the universe is only thirteen point eight or so billion years old so these black holes seem to be too massive to exist at the at this period of time so Big Bounce might be actually proven or I guess have more support from the discovery of this particular quasar at this particular galaxy now that's really all we know about it for now because we've only discovered a few months ago so is ul ASG 1342 0 9 to 8 you can't really find it anywhere in any of the databases that I've used so far and you can't really find in a space engine either unfortunately but at some point hopefully the quasars will be added to the database of in space engine so maybe just maybe we'll get to visit it and even light on some kind of a really cool procedurally generated planet at the edge of the known universe right here in space engine for now that's all I wanted to talk about and in one of the future videos I will show you how I did this beautiful quasar using your sandbox anyway thank you so much for watching guys I'll see you tomorrow come back tomorrow to learn something else space out and as always bye bye
DPrJm6lOOGE,10:13,pt-BR,false,true,ok,,"O mundo em que vivemos parece normal, comum. Parece que os humanos simplesmente existem e sempre existiram dessa forma. Mas nÃ£o Ã© bem assim. Nunca antes, nÃ³s, humanos, vivemos num mundo tÃ£o sofisticado e projetadoÂ  para nossas necessidades como hoje em dia. Podemos nos dar ao luxo de relaxar e nÃ£o nos preocupar com a nossa sobrevivÃªncia. Alimento, abrigo, seguranÃ§a, tudo isso Ã©, de certo modo, garantido. Mas nÃ³s temos sorte. Por mais de 99,99% da histÃ³ria humana, a vida foi completamente diferente. E nÃ£o existe sÃ³ uma histÃ³ria humana. Nossa histÃ³ria comeÃ§a hÃ¡ 6 milhÃµes de anos, quando a tribo de Hominini se separou e nosso relacionamento com os sÃ­mios acabou. 2,8 milhÃµes de anos atrÃ¡s, surgiu o gÃªnero Homo, os primeiros humanos. Gostamos de pensar que somos os Ãºnicos seres humanos, mas isso estÃ¡ longe da verdade: Quando nÃ³s, Homo sapiens sapiens, surgimos, hÃ¡ 200.000 anos, havia pelo menos seis outras espÃ©cies humanas por aÃ­. Primos, com inteligÃªncia e habilidade comparÃ¡veis Ã s nossas, o que pode ter sido bem assustador. Como viver entre alienÃ­genas. Alguns deles tiveram muito sucesso. O Homo erectus, por exemplo, sobreviveu por dois milhÃµes de anos, dez vezes mais do que os humanos modernos tÃªm existido. O Ãºltimo dos outros humanos desapareceu hÃ¡ cerca de 10.000 anos, e nÃ³s nÃ£o sabemos o que os levou Ã  morte. Os humanos modernos tÃªm um pouco de DNA Neandertal e de outros humanos. EntÃ£o, houve mistura, mas com certeza nÃ£o o suficiente para fundir as espÃ©cies. Portanto, nÃ£o sabemos se nossos primos sumiram por perderem a batalha por recursos ou por sofrerem uma sÃ©rie de pequenos genocÃ­dios. De qualquer forma, sÃ³ restamos nÃ³s. Voltando aos primÃ³rdios da humanidade, hÃ¡ 2,8 milhÃµes de anos, os humanos jÃ¡ usavam ferramentas, mas pouco progrediram por quase 2 milhÃµes de anos. AtÃ© que eles aprenderam a controlar o fogo! O fogo significava cozimento. Isso tornou a comida mais nutritiva e ajudou nosso cÃ©rebro a se desenvolver. Ele tambÃ©m produzia luz e calor, tornando os dias mais longos e osÂ  invernos mais suportÃ¡veis. E mais, nÃ£o sÃ³ assustava os predadores, mas tambÃ©m poderia ser usado para caÃ§ar. Um bosque ou campo queimado fornecia pequenos animais, castanhas e tubÃ©rculos prÃ©-cozidos. HÃ¡ cerca de 300.000 anos, a maioria das espÃ©cies humanas vivia em pequenosÂ  grupos de caÃ§adores-coletores. Eles tinham fogo, ferramentas de madeira e pedra, planejavam o futuro, enterravam seus mortos e tinham culturas prÃ³prias. Mas, o mais importante: Eles falavam uns com os outros. Provavelmente numa espÃ©cie de protolinguagem, menos complexa que a nossa. Se tivÃ©ssemos uma mÃ¡quina do tempo, quÃ£o longe poderÃ­amos voltar, roubar alguns bebÃªs e criÃ¡-los hoje sem que ninguÃ©m percebesse que eles sÃ£o... um pouco diferentes? Isso Ã© muito debatido. Os humanos anatomicamente modernos surgiram hÃ¡ 200.000 anos, mas provavelmente 70.000 anos Ã© o mÃ¡ximo que poderÃ­amos voltar no tempo e encontrar um humano com comportamento moderno. Antes disso, Ã© provÃ¡vel que os bebÃªs nÃ£o tivessem mutaÃ§Ãµes genÃ©ticas cruciais para desenvolver habilidades como linguagem moderna e pensamento abstrato. Em algum momento, 50.000 anos atrÃ¡s, houve uma explosÃ£o em inovaÃ§Ã£o. Ferramentas e armas se tornaram mais sofisticadas, e a cultura se tornou mais complexa, pois naquele momento os humanos tinham um cÃ©rebro multifuncional e uma linguagem mais avanÃ§ada, o que permitia uma comunicaÃ§Ã£o mais eficaz e detalhada. Isso nos permitiu maior cooperaÃ§Ã£o, o que realmente nos torna diferentes de qualquer outra criatura na Terra: nossos corpos sÃ£o fracos e nossos sentidos sÃ£o inferiores; mas temos a capacidade de cooperar em grandes grupos de forma flexÃ­vel. Ao contrÃ¡rio, por exemplo, das rÃ­gidas colmeias ou das Ã­ntimas, porÃ©m minÃºsculas, alcateias. A evoluÃ§Ã£o do nosso cÃ©rebro nos tornou capazes de fazer algo que a vida, atÃ© entÃ£o, nÃ£o havia conseguido: 1-expandir o conhecimento rapidamente. 2-preservar o conhecimento adquirido ao longo de geraÃ§Ãµes. 3-construir sobre o conhecimento passado para aprofundÃ¡-lo ainda mais. Isso parece bobo, mas atÃ© entÃ£o as informaÃ§Ãµes tinham que ser transmitidas de geraÃ§Ã£o em geraÃ§Ã£o principalmente por meio da genÃ©tica â€“ o que nÃ£o Ã© eficiente. Ainda assim, pelos prÃ³ximos 40.000 anos, a vida humana permaneceria mais ou menos a mesma. Havia pouco para construir, nossos ancestrais eram apenas um entre tantos animais. Construir um arranha-cÃ©u sem saber o que Ã© uma casa Ã© difÃ­cil. Ã‰ fÃ¡cil ser arrogante para com nossos ancestrais, mas isso Ã© uma ignorÃ¢ncia. Os humanos, hÃ¡ 50.000 anos, eram especialistas em sobrevivÃªncia. Eles tinham um mapa mental detalhado de seu territÃ³rio e seus sentidos eram ajustados ao meio ambiente. Conheciam e memorizavam muitas informaÃ§Ãµes sobre plantas e animais. Eles podiam fazer ferramentas complicadas, cujo uso exigiam anos de treinamento cuidadoso e muita habilidade motora. Seus corpos eram comparÃ¡veis aos dos atletas atuais e, dentro da tribo, a vida social era rica. A sobrevivÃªncia exigia tanto dos primeiros humanos modernos que o volume mÃ©dio dos seus cÃ©rebros pode ter sido maior do que Ã© hoje. Como grupo, temos mais conhecimento hoje; mas como indivÃ­duos, nossos ancestrais eram superiores a nÃ³s. Mas aÃ­, cerca de 12.000 anos atrÃ¡s, em vÃ¡rios locais, os humanos desenvolveram a agricultura. Isso mudou tudo muito rapidamente. Antes, a sobrevivÃªncia como caÃ§ador-coletor exigia habilidades fÃ­sicas e mentais extremas, em todas as Ã¡reas, de todo mundo. Com o crescimento da agricultura, os indivÃ­duos podiam confiar cada vez mais nas habilidades dos outros para sobreviver. E aÃ­, alguns se especializaram. Talvez tenham aprimorado as ferramentas, talvez tenham cultivado plantas ouÂ  animais mais resistentes. Talvez tenham comeÃ§ado a inventar coisas. O aumento da eficiÃªncia da agricultura originou o que chamamos de civilizaÃ§Ã£o. A agricultura, fonte confiÃ¡vel e previsÃ­vel de alimento, permitiu-nos, finalmente, acumular alimento em grande escala, o que Ã© mais fÃ¡cil com grÃ£os do que com carne. Para proteger o estoque de comida, os grupos passaram a viver em espaÃ§os restritos. Foram criadas estruturasÂ  de defesa, e a necessidade de organizaÃ§Ã£o cresceu. Quanto mais organizados ficÃ¡vamos, mais eficientes as coisas ficavam. Aldeias se tornaram cidades. Cidades se tornaram reinos. Reinos se tornaram impÃ©rios. As conexÃµes entre humanos explodiram, o que criou oportunidades de trocar conhecimento. O progresso se tornou exponencial. Cerca de 500 anos atrÃ¡s, a revoluÃ§Ã£o cientÃ­fica comeÃ§ou: A matemÃ¡tica, a fÃ­sica, a astronomia, a biologia e a quÃ­mica transformaram tudo o que pensÃ¡vamos saber. Logo em seguida, a RevoluÃ§Ã£o Industrial lanÃ§ava as bases para o mundo moderno. Ã€ medida que nossa eficiÃªncia geral crescia, mais pessoas podiam passar a vida contribuindo para o progresso da humanidade. RevoluÃ§Ãµes continuaram acontecendo: a invenÃ§Ã£o do computador, sua evoluÃ§Ã£o para algo que todos usamos diariamente, e a ascensÃ£o da internet, moldaram nosso mundo. Ã‰ difÃ­cil compreender a rapidez com que tudo isso aconteceu. JÃ¡ se passaram cerca de 125.000 geraÃ§Ãµes desde o surgimento da primeira espÃ©cie humana e cerca de 7.500 geraÃ§Ãµes desde que o ser humano fisiologicamente moderno viu a luz do dia. 500 geraÃ§Ãµes atrÃ¡s, surgiu o que chamamos de civilizaÃ§Ã£o. HÃ¡ 20 geraÃ§Ãµes, aprendemos a fazer ciÃªncia. E a internet se popularizou hÃ¡ apenas uma geraÃ§Ã£o! Hoje vivemos na era mais prÃ³spera que a humanidade jÃ¡ vivenciou. Transformamos este planeta: desde a composiÃ§Ã£o da atmosfera atÃ© mudanÃ§as em larga escala da sua paisagem, bem como em relaÃ§Ã£o aos outros animais existentes. Iluminamos a noite com estrelas artificiais, colocamos pessoas em caixas de metal no cÃ©u, e algumas atÃ© andaram na Lua. Colocamos robÃ´s em outros planetas. Olhamos para o passado do universo com olhos mecÃ¢nicos. Nosso conhecimento e as formas de obtÃª-lo e armazenÃ¡-lo explodiram: um estudante comum do ensino mÃ©dio hoje sabe mais sobre o universo do que os eruditos alguns sÃ©culos atrÃ¡s. Os humanos dominam este planeta, mesmo que esse domÃ­nio seja muito frÃ¡gil. NÃ£o somos tÃ£o diferentes de nossos ancestrais hÃ¡ 70.000 anos, mas nosso estilo de vida existe hÃ¡ menos de 0,001% da histÃ³ria humana. Daqui em diante, nÃ£o hÃ¡ como dizer o que o futuro nos reserva. Estamos construindo um arranha-cÃ©u, mas nÃ£o sabemos se estÃ¡ sendo construÃ­do em base sÃ³lida ou em areia movediÃ§a. Mas vamos deixar isso para lÃ¡. Da prÃ³xima vez que perder o trem, que o hambÃºrguer estiver frio ou que alguÃ©m cortar a fila, lembre-se de quÃ£o especial Ã© esse mundo que criamos. Talvez nÃ£o valha a pena se aborrecer por coisinhas pequenas. Este vÃ­deo foi patrocinado por vocÃª.

F1vfWHaaxfo,8:32,en,true,true,ok,,okay hello and let's talk about cardiac signal transmission which is basically um how does the heartbeat what causes causes the heartbeat um it all starts with this area right here there's a kind of a tissue here I'm going to draw it in green because this is how it starts so green means go traffic light right um and this area is called I'm going to write right here this is called signal atrial node sinoatrial node this is the first tissue that starts the signal so it's kind of a pacemaker basically it generates the electrical signal and normally it's also referred to as S node so we're going to call it aay Noe um it's um it generates a signal It Starts Here although however almost every cell inside the heart can generate signal so if this if this tissue fail if it doesn't work anymore then the next uh tissue will start the signal so it's not a um it's not a kind of a very essential part but it does start because it's it beats slightly or sorry it generates signal slightly faster than other tissues so it's basically it's the source of the signal and it connects to your this is your right ventricle right sorry your right right atrium and this is your left atrium and it connects to both of them so it basically causes your left and right Atria to contract so it contracts your Atria Atrium contraction so this is how it starts then from here I'm going to draw this in red it sends this signal to the area right here this is red because now it stops you need to pause this uh contraction so it's going to pause this in the second area [Music] called an ventricular entry ventricular node also known as AV node and the reason why called ENT ventricular is because it it's basically on the border of Atria and ventricles and AV node uh its main purpose is basically to provide a kind of a delay between contractions why well because you don't want your um Atria and ventricles to contract at the same time you want to contract your Atria first you contract this first so that the blood flows from here to here right right you want to create pressure it flows here and then you contract your ventricles so that the blood flows from here to here and from here to here so this is why there's this delay and it's produced by AV node then from The Av node it goes I'm going to change the color I'm going to use orange because I'm going for traffic light here uh from a v node which is right here it goes down over here and over here and it goes down in two kind of bundles of these these nerves nerve bundles uh and these nerves so the uh the right one goes here the right one goes to the right side the left one goes to the left side and these two bundles have a name um they're called well there they are known usually known as AV bundles but they also have a different name a more common name they're known as [Music] bundles of his with Capital H because it's someone's name bundles of his and so they conduct signal from The Av node so the conduct signal from The Av node down to the next part conduct electrical signal and the next part I'm going to draw it in green again because this is also go this is also a signal generation uh but in ventricles this time so this goes down here and spreads into these long long fibers that anovate your ventricles because now you want to contract your ventricles so these fibers are here and these fibers have a name as well everything in inside the heart has a name because it's the coolest organ and the name for this fiber is it's a funny name but you'll probably never forget it because it's such a weird name they're called pingi pingi fibers pingi fibers and these fibers basically generate electric signal inside your ventricles ventricle signal generation now there's a delay between this this here and this here the is usually around um it's it's it's under 1 second so that's why you actually hear the p p p p uh because it starts with your Atria and then it goes into ventric ventricles um the delay between these two is around one10 of a second one/ tenth of a second but you don't really have to know this so just to kind of repeat all this so let's just draw our traffic light green green then we have our orange orange here and then we have our red red so this is our traffic light it's a funny traffic light but that's how it's going to be because it's easy to remember this way all right so hard traffic light first we start with green this is your SA node SA node this is the past maker saay node then you have your red second one is red this is the AV node this is red stop it's a delay one tenth of a second delay then we have our next part which is the bundles of his this is a transmission it's orange it's transmission bundles of his and finally the last one is go again this time it's ventricles fori fibers foringer fibers contract your ventricles and one more thing I'm going to mention is something about the aay node your aay node is actually uh innervated by two things one of them is a nerve from your sympathetic nervous system if you remember correctly SNS is uh this is your fight or flight response right so SNS causes your heart to beat faster increases heartbeat and it does it by inating the SA node so if your SA node is not functioning well your parasympathetic and sympathetic system is not going to be able to control your heart very well um and know it's also inated by another nerve this is your um parasympathetic nervous system pns so this is to decrease your heartbeat decrease your heartbeat and this uh this is something you should know this nerve is called your vagus nerve vagus v a g s so vagus nerve innervates your sa note as well and decreases the heartbeat all right well this is all you should know for Signal Transmission in relating to the heart and thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye
p35YZGouDss,16:18,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person this is anton and today we're going to be talking about genome and the main topic is actually the largest genome in the animal kingdom can you guess what has the largest genome ever what organism do you think has essentially the longest dna of all of the organisms on the planet now this question actually has several answers depending on what organism you look at but in general we're actually going to be focusing on the so-called vertebrates on the animals and in this case of all of the animals in the world surprisingly humans are not even close to having the longest genome the longest one belongs to something entirely different but let's actually discuss the idea of dna in genome because it's actually a super fascinating topic if you've ever taken high school biology you probably still remember that the dna of human beings and pretty much dna of most of the advanced organisms is made up of these chromosomes and humans as you might remember have 23 pairs in other words there are 46 of them in total and so for example when you hear someone talk about human genome it basically means all of the chromosomes plus the genetic material from inside our mitochondria for various evolutionary reasons mitochondria have their own dna and though most of the genome's dna is right here inside the nucleus of a cell there's a little bit of it here in the mitochondria as well but i remember back in the days when i was still trying to study all of this i had a lot of questions about all of these molecules all of these chromosomes and i really wanted to understand how all this is packed inside the nucleus most of the teachers unfortunately didn't always have answers so i basically went on these long tracks trying to discover all of the answers and well it turns out it's actually a really really complex process and a really complex structure that when you start learning kind of becomes super fascinating so first of all one of the questions i always had is are these molecules are these chromosomes actually connected to one another or are they completely separate and turns out that inside our nuclei right now inside our cells all of these chromosomes are essentially these separate molecules so inside each of the nucleus of most of the cells you're going to discover 46 of these very specific molecules wrapped into these really really tight shapes so tight as a matter of fact that of approximately 2 meters or 6 feet of length of the dna you can essentially fit all of them into the tiny tiny nucleus of a typical cell and when i found out how long this thing was it kind of blew my mind now i'm one of those people that actually still uses earbuds with an actual cable to listen to stuff on my phone and because of very neural properties of long objects such as cables my earbuds always get tangled into these tight knots that i have to untangle once in a while but through billions of years of evolution the nature has found a way to keep all these cables all of these dna strands completely separate from one another and despite their length they never get entangled not even once and that is absolutely fascinating and what's more is that nature also found a very efficient and very interesting way of storing all of these dna molecules inside the nucleus as well for example i was always wondering how are these chromosomes stored inside the cell do they just kind of freely move around do they kind of float around in this large vessel or is there a certain way that they're stored so that the cell actually knows where they are and so that they can actually be used efficiently well turns out the answer is the latter each chromosome has a very specific individual location inside the nucleus each stored forming this very unusual shape that kind of looks like this and this is as tight as you can pack them inside the nucleus of a typical cell now remember each of these is a separate molecule with the shortest one being roughly around 15 million base pairs long with a single base pair basically being something like this it's two molecules connected together and so the smallest one has 50 million of these and the largest one has roughly around 260 million and each of them then gets rolled up and sort of stored in this particular shape you see right here although this is only for humans each animal and each species will have different number and obviously different shapes forming and depending on the number of chromosomes and their length this is of course going to be very different but now let's talk about the length of different genomes and also how this length possibly relates to various organisms so in general human genome is actually on the longer side but it's not the longest and here it's also important to understand that the genome's length itself does not actually represent the complexity or the intelligence of the organism in any way neither does it make the organism in some way more successful so it's actually very interesting how the length of the genome doesn't actually correlate with anything although okay that's not entirely true genome size does correlate with the type of the organism you're looking at so viruses will have the shortest of the genomes the ancient bacteria known as archaea will have the second shortest then we'll have regular bacteria and the last oil will have eukaryotes or the true cells and that's of course all of the advanced organisms on the planet and all of the cells that we are made out of as well but even amongst these organisms there are always a lot of exceptions and this is where things get a little bit more interesting now first of all just like i mentioned the length of the chromosome doesn't mean much as a matter of fact in the human genome only about two percent of the entire length of all of the chromosomes are responsible for producing you for producing the proteins that you're made out of everything else are extras so of everything you see right here only two percent is used by the body by the cells to produce other cells and here's what the typical human genome will look like it will have only two percent of genes responsible for various proteins and the rest of the genome is actually going to be made up of other things now back in the days when i was in high school the biology teacher referred to these as junk dna but in the last decade or so actually in the last couple of decades these scientists realized that this is a completely wrong term to use a lot of this extra stuff that's there is really important we just don't really know what most of it is yet we've discovered for example that a lot of it is responsible for assisting fetal development such as various genes that came from various viruses that are still inside our genome there's actually a video about this summer up there but also a lot of them are the so-called jumping jeans or transposable elements also known as transposons these unusual genes are responsible for well basically relocating once in a while through the entire strand of the dna their only job seems to be to jump and they do this for various random reasons once in a while and it seems that the length of the genome depends directly on how many of these transposons are located inside the cell so animals with the longest genome will actually just have more of these transposons on the inside at least for the most part and their only job is to jump but why do they do so and how is it helping us turns out that by jumping around they do actually introduce occasional mutations into proteins and this is basically evolution in in a nutshell by jumping around and by occasionally changing the genetic code they can cause mutations that can then lead to either advantages or disadvantages but what about the length well in terms of the length like i said humans are on the longer side as well as organisms like typical monkeys apes even mice actually usually the length of the genome here is going to be between two and possibly three and a half billion base pairs so if you were to think about one base pair being for example one bite a typical human genome will actually contain about 3.3 gigabytes of information certain monkeys and certain apes will even have more and mice that we often use in experiments will have about 2.7 billion and for most mammals the length is usually a few billion pairs for fish and for things like birds it's less it's usually actually less than a billion surprisingly the genome in a typical bird is much shorter than other animals and one of the reasons scientists believe so is because birds for some reason lost a huge chunk of the genome when they started to adapt to flying now that's not something we can prove yet but that's the usual explanation to why their genome is shorter so for example a typical chicken will have something around 1 billion base pairs but the question is what has the longest genome we found so far of all of the animals and when i originally learned the answer it really surprised me but then i started thinking about it and it kind of all made sense one of the longest genomes you can find is actually inside of this really strange somewhat ugly and somewhat unusual creature known as the longfish in this case we're actually talking about the australian lungfish because that's the one that was recently investigated in the paper that as always you can find in the description below and we've always known that the lungfish genome was really long but all of the studies about them were actually decades old and using a very old technology that was not actually accurate the recent study used an extremely accurate way to calculate all of this using some really sophisticated computer techniques and essentially discovered that a typical long fish will have a genome that's about 14 times longer than the one inside humans about 43 billion base pairs or basically about 43 gigabytes of information but that's also around 100 times longer than a typical fish such as this little guy so something here doesn't actually adapt how can this fish have a short dna or short genome yet this strange creature having genome that's about 100 times as long and though there's no actual real explanation just yet there is a pretty good speculation and also a potential explanation to how evolution works as well the thing about lungfish which by the way exists on all major continents is that we believe them to be what's known as a living fossil there are types of creatures that haven't really changed genetically haven't evolved much in millions and millions of years and for these fish it might have been as long as 200 or even 300 million years essentially today most scientists believe that the lungfish right here are the very important evolutionary link between the land animals and the fish right before they became land animals but unlike other long fish that probably evolved into other animals these lungfish for some reason stopped their evolution and remained as they were millions and millions of years ago now we actually have some other living fossils out there the famous one being the tree known as ginkgo biloba and what seems to unite all of them is that they all possess these very very long genomes in other words their genetic code seems to be extremely long compared to some of the other species similar to them and this by itself is an important clue to potentially how evolution works and how it helps animals and other creatures evolve when the genome is too short the evolution is going to be too fast there are going to be too many mutations and chances for the organism to survive especially in stable conditions are not going to be very high because for stability you need the dna to be stable but if the dna molecule is too long if the mutations will take too long and if it also keeps growing larger and larger at some point all of those jumping genes that i mentioned before all of those transposons are going to be simply unable to mutate the dna molecule so they're going to be jumping around but they're not going to be affecting any of the proteins and so the evolution at this point kind of stops because the dna molecule the genome became extremely long unable to mutate now it might work well for some creatures like these guys so long fish might actually benefit from it and survive for pretty much hundreds of millions of years but it obviously did not help everyone and some fish and especially some long fish that probably existed at that time as well did go extinct and there are actually signs of this in many different fossils we've discovered over the past few decades and so by itself the study is actually extremely interesting in trying to understand how life evolved on the planet and in trying to understand how the length of the genome may actually play a role in various other creatures as well but in case of the lungfish there are just so many cool things about it that it's actually kind of difficult to cover all of this in one video for example one of the reasons they're cold along fish is because they do have a lung they can actually breathe air without the presence of water and some lung fish in certain countries can even survive dry conditions when the water disappears completely this adaptation obviously helped the longfish to eventually evolve into other creatures interestingly they also contain many different adaptations specifically genetic adaptations to survive on land many of them have feet like formations many of them have something that resembles a nose and can actually smell molecules unlike other fish and obviously all of them have lungs as well but at the same time they also contain a tremendous amount of genes that are only in fish so these lung fish are both terrestrial animals and fish and they contain dna and actual genes from both types of the creatures and so some scientists believe that longfish are basically like libraries of different types of genes and different dna molecules from various species across the evolutionary timeline and so studying them is actually super important in helping us understand how life evolved and how life progressed and essentially moved from the oceans to the land and then evolved afterwards but when it comes to the longest genome in the world of all of the creatures including bacteria and so on they're still not the winners there's actually something else that has even longer genome at least according to some of the older studies one of them is this strange flower known as paris japonica with a genome that's roughly around three times as long at 150 billion base pairs and one of them is an amiibo-like creature or basically a single cellular organism known as polychaos dubium and this organism has a genome that's about 670 billion base pairs long which is about 15 to 16 times longer than the genome inside the lungfish and about 200 or so times longer than the one inside of humans and so once again the length of the genome does not seem to correlate with the complexity of the organism intelligence or anything else it does seem to correlate with evolution though and that's something that we actually are trying to understand right now especially in learning more about how various complex life arose on earth and how it could potentially do so on other planets as well but i guess for now that's really all i wanted to mention in this video the paper and all the links i used today are as always in the description below so thank you for watching subscribe if you still haven't share this with someone who loves to learn about space sciences and biology and come back tomorrow to learn something else also maybe support this channel on patreon or by buying the wonderful prison t-shirt you can find in the description i'll see you tomorrow space

DJO_9auJhJQ,17:55,en,false,true,ok,,"- Arthur C. Clarke had a sequel to ""2001, A Space Odyssey."" It's called ""2010, Odyssey Two."" And at the end of it, an alien intelligence converts Jupiter into a star. As a group of astronauts narrowly escape the implosion, they receive the following message from the aliens, ""All these worlds are yours, except Europa, attempt no landing there."" Now that was just a novel, but it suggests that already in 1982, we suspected that Europa might offer our best chance of finding alien life in the solar system. 42 years later, in October 2024, NASA is actually launching the most advanced mission to hunt for signs of alien life. And it's going to Jupiter's moon Europa. There's just one problem, Jupiter kills everything around it. So how could life exist there? And how do you make a probe that can withstand the perilous conditions? (suspenseful music) (gentle music) Deep inside Jupiter, there is so much pressure, that hydrogen is believed to take the form of a metallic liquid. And this metallic liquid hydrogen generates an incredibly powerful magnetic field, almost 20,000 times stronger than Earth, if you measure at the same distance away. So if you could see this magnetic field from Earth, it would appear twice as big as the full moon. On its own, that magnetic field is harmless. But right in the middle of it is the most volcanically active world in the solar system, Jupiter's moon, Io. The volcanoes on Io's surface shoot out tons of sulfur dioxide, and every second, one ton of this material gets ionized and trapped inside Jupiter's magnetic field. And the field accelerates these particles to rotate incredibly fast with Jupiter. So they whizz around at over 300 kilometers per second. Their inertia actually pulls back on the field, stretching it out. And this trapped material slams into other moons, ejecting even more particles from their surfaces. This cycle forms massive radiation belts which span past Europa and the other moons of Jupiter. Now, for electronics, this intense radiation is kryptonite. In the 1970s, the Pioneer 10 and Voyager missions only briefly passed by Jupiter, but the radiation caused glitches, gave the instruments false commands, and corrupted some of their data. Even with modern shielding, a spacecraft within the radiation belts would only survive for around three months. So how will NASA's new mission, the Europa Clipper, orbit Europa for over four years without getting fried? Well, the solution is, it won't. It'll orbit Jupiter from afar and then swoop in every few weeks to quickly fly by Europa and then leave again. And since the mission is going to collect a lot of data, it can use the downtime while it's way out here to transmit it all back to Earth before going in for another swoop. In all, it'll do 49 flybys, mapping almost the entire surface. That's actually how the Clipper got its name, after the fast and nimble 19th century Clipper ships, quickly dipping in and out of ports. But of all the places in the solar system to look for life, why Europa? If you stood on Europa's surface, you'd be hit with 5,400 milliSieverts of radiation in a single day. That's 1,800 times more than the annual dose here on Earth. If you stay here for a couple of hours, you would eventually die from radiation sickness. But Europa contains a secret. When Voyager 1 passed by Jupiter in 1979, it took this photo of Europa. If you compare it to most of the other moons in the solar system, you'll notice something is missing, craters. Every planet and moon has been bombarded by asteroids over billions of years. And most planetary surfaces show it. But not Europa. So why not? Well, something recent, say over the last 60 million years or so, must have been happening on Europa to erase most of these craters from the surface. 16 years after Voyager, Galileo arrived to Jupiter. It spent eight years studying both the gas giant and its moons. And Galileo's magnetometer picked up something interesting on Europa. Jupiter's magnetic poles, like Earth's, aren't aligned with its geographic poles. So as the planet rotates every 10 hours, the whole magnetic field wobbles. This changing field from Jupiter induces a magnetic field on Europa, and a relatively strong one at that. That means there must be an electrically conductive layer within Europa that reacts to Jupiter's field. And readings from Galileo indicate that it must be somewhere close to the surface, only 10s of kilometers deep. So what kind of conductive layer? Well, Europa's white surface is almost entirely covered in a thick crust of water ice. These reddish-brown regions, when observed through a spectrometer, fit the description of a lot of things, like hydrated salts, sulfuric acid or even bacteria. We need more data to be sure, but recent experiments at JPL found that sea salt when bombarded with intense radiation, turns from white to this same brownish color found on Europa. So scientists suspect that there's a whole saltwater ocean inside Europa that could be 100 kilometers deep. Meaning that Europa would contain twice as much water as the whole of the Earth. And it must driving geological activity that constantly smooths out and renews the surface of the moon. But the Jupiter system only gets about 4% of the sunlight we get here on Earth. So Europa's surface is constantly below -160 deg Celsius, so you'd expect the ocean to be frozen solid. But there's a way to generate heat that doesn't rely on the Sun. And I've got a little demo here to prove it. Europa's orbit around Jupiter isn't a perfect circle. This is because Io, Europa and Ganymede are in orbital resonance. Each time Ganymede completes one orbit, Europa completes two and Io four. Because of that, Io tugs Europa inward on one side of the orbit, while Ganymede pulls it out on the other, making its orbit more eccentric. Now, Jupiter's pull is stronger on the closer side of the orbit than on the farther side. So Europa is constantly being stretched and squeezed, stretched and squeezed. And you can see how this rubber ball gets warmer as I squeeze it. Scientists believe that the friction caused by the tidal flexing of the entire moon can generate enough heat to keep the ocean liquid. This effect gets stronger the closer you are to Jupiter, which is why Io is so volcanically active. So you can see this ball is significantly hotter now. I held onto this ball at the same time to make sure that it wasn't just the heat coming in from my hand. What sort of temperature of the ocean are we thinking? - So it depends on how salty it is. So, melting temperature of ice or maybe depressed by 10 degrees Celsius below that if it's a very salty ocean. Similar to cold oceans on Earth. - And how would the flexing differ if there's this big liquid ocean versus if there's no ocean there? - If there's no ocean, Europa should flex by only about one meter in amplitude. But if there's an ocean in there, then it flexes with an amplitude of 30 meters. So that's an enormous deflection. And that will come out pretty clearly in the gravity data. Another argument for how thick the ice shell is, we see these very strange features on the surface that are arcuate in shape, but like multiple arcs put together. We call them cycloids. Not something you'd expect to see on an icy moon. And we think they form if a crack propagates at just the right speed, about the speed someone would walk, and is following the changing stress field of Europa being squeezed as it orbits around Jupiter. And if there were no ocean down there, there wouldn't be enough of an amplitude of that motion to explain the cracking. But if there is an ocean, then it could explain the cracking. - All that tidal flexing pushes magma in the outer core up, closer to the seafloor. Water flowing through the crust above it is heated and it picks up minerals from the ground, ejecting them into the ocean. This creates hydrothermal vents. And where we find these on Earth, we also find life. Thousands of meters below the surface, with no sunlight, these vents are oases for ocean life. The lifeforms down here rely on unique bacteria, bacteria that feed on the minerals from the vents, rather than on the energy provided by the Sun. How long are we thinking that Europa has had an ocean? - It could be four billion years, we don't know for sure. - That amount of time could give life the opportunity to evolve in those oceans? - Right, exactly right. Organisms can use methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur reactions. Any chemical reaction you can think of that might happen in the ocean can potentially be used as a fuel for that organism's metabolism. So we're not talking about searching for fishes, or whales or squids or something down there, but looking for single cell organisms. - We were so concerned there might be life on Europa that, when the Galileo mission was ending in 2003, it was deliberately crashed into Jupiter to avoid the risk of contaminating Europa. But Clipper will not be able to drill through the kilometers-thick ice crust. So how are we going to find evidence for life beneath that thick surface? This is the SnotBot. It's a drone with Petri dishes glued to the top, and it flies right through whale blows to collect whale snot right here on Earth. And zoologists can use the SnotBot to retrieve all sorts of info on a whale's biology. And it turns we can do something very similar for celestial bodies too. We've actually captured images of water geysers shooting out of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, housing a subsurface ocean. And the Hubble space telescope has picked up some evidence of what could be similar geyser eruptions on Europa. The hope is that Clipper could fly through one of these plumes, like the SnotBot, and reveal their chemical composition using a mass spectrometer. But evidence for an ocean on Europa isn't conclusive. Enceladus seems like a stronger candidate, we have actual images of its plumes and we've even flown through them. We are almost 100% certain there's a subsurface ocean there. If we have these plumes on Enceladus and there's clearly maybe a liquid ocean there, why does Europa have your attention more than Enceladus? Is there something that draws you? - We don't know how long it takes life to get going, but it's possible that Enceladus may have just kind of started up its engines, whereas Europa has more likely been well evolved over a long time. - Surprisingly, being bombarded by Jupiter's radiation actually makes Europa a better candidate. See, those high-speed particles hitting Europa's surface give water and carbon dioxide molecules enough energy to form new compounds, like formaldehyde or hydrogen peroxide. And these can serve as food for life beneath the surface, if they can get down that far. - And we have evidence of overturn of the icy shell at chaos zones where the icy crust seems to have collided and material has been shoved into the icy shell. So there may be ways for this fuel for life to get down into the icy shell and potentially to the ocean. - [Derek] And Clipper doesn't have to touch down on the surface to confirm this. - There's an infrared spectrometer to look at the chemical fingerprints of light bounced off the surface to help identify and map out where the salts are, find if there are organics there. There is an ultraviolet spectrograph that's aboard the spacecraft to look for plumes. Are they there? And of course, then can we fly through them? And then there'll be imaging of essentially the whole globe at better than 100 meters per pixel resolution. So one camera will take swaths of images as we fly over the surface and that's called the wide angle camera. And then the other camera is the narrow angle camera. From 50 kilometers altitude, it will get half meter per pixel images, right? So it'll be able to resolve my desk here if it were on Europa. And then it would be a future mission, like a lander that would go and actually search for signs of life on Europa. - Do you think a lander would have a chance of survival? - There have been studies that say we can get a lander living on the surface for a month. If we think that's sufficient to go in there, scoop some stuff up from below the depth of radiation processing, and put it into a mass spectrometer and see what we see. - But the Europa Clipper won't be studying Jupiter's moons alone. The European Space Agency's JUICE mission, or the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer, is already on its way to Jupiter. It will come to the system just 15 months after Clipper and it'll even be doing a few flybys of Europa, before settling into a tight orbit around Ganymede. So the European Space Agency will also have a mission there at the same time? - Yes, we're having informal conversations with members of the JUICE science team. What would it mean to have two spacecraft there at the same time? The JUICE mission will end up in orbit around Ganymede and Ganymede has its own magnetosphere. Well, we'll be outside Ganymede's magnetosphere. So we might say, ""Oh, look, there's this big burst coming from Jupiter."" And then JUICE might say, ""Oh, we felt that over here in our magnetic signals."" So we wouldn't have to really do anything different except talk to each other and make sure that the sum of the whole is even bigger than its parts. - Europa Clipper was scheduled to launch on October 10, 2024, but NASA is waiting for Hurricane Milton to clear Florida before the spacecraft can take off safely. When will we get the first results? - You'll start seeing distant observations coming in in 2030 as we look at Europa from afar and search for plumes. And then you'll see the first really high resolution data in 2031. - So after say 26 years of thinking about a mission to Europa, how does it feel to be so close to launch? - It's a little surreal, (laughs) I must say. This has been such a long time coming. It's occasionally hitting me that our spacecraft is going to be up there in the heavens, right, on its way. It turns out that, during a Europa Ocean Conference in the late 1990s, NASA actually video-called Arthur C. Clarke. And after showing him plans for a future mission to explore the faraway ocean world, Clarke finally gave NASA permission to land on Europa. (monitor whooshing) Europa Clipper is a perfect example of the amazing things we can do when we set ourselves ambitious goals and work together with others to achieve them.

IgF3OX8nT0w,20:13,en,false,true,ok,,"- In 1901, this ancient Greek artifact was discovered in a shipwreck of the island of Antikythera. 3D x-ray scans have revealed it contains 37 interlocking bronze gears, allowing it to model the motions of the sun and moon, and predict eclipses decades in advance. Constructed around 100 or 200 BC, the Antikythera mechanism represents a sophisticated early computer. The likes of which would not be seen again for at least a thousand years. Now, of course, this computer didn't work like modern digital computers. It works by analogy. The gears were constructed in such a way that the motions of certain dials are analogous to the motion of the sun and moon. It is an analog computer. - Here is a simple analog computer for adding two numbers together. If you turn the black wheel some amount and then turn this white wheel a different amount, the gray wheel shows the sum of the two rotations. In contrast, this is a digital mechanical computer where you can add two single bit numbers. So zero plus zero equals zero. Zero plus one equals one. And one plus one equals two. These two devices illustrate the differences between analog and digital computers. Analog computers have a continuous range of inputs and outputs, whereas digital only works with discrete values. With analog computers, the quantities of interest are actually represented by something physical, like the amount a wheel has turned. Whereas digital computers work on symbols like zeros and ones. If the answer is, say, two, there is nothing in the computer that is 'twice as much' as a one. In analog computers, there is. For thousands of years, people used analog devices like the Antikythera mechanism or slide rules, alongside digital devices like abacuses. And up until the 1960s, the most powerful computers on the planet were actually analog. Digital computers exploded onto the scene with the advent of solid-state transistors. And now, almost everything is digital. Most people have never even heard of analog computers. But today, that may all be changing. Moore's Law, the idea that you can double the number of transistors on a chip every two years, it's reaching its limit, because transistors are nearly the same size as atoms. Simultaneously, advancements in machine learning are straining the capabilities of digital computers. The solution to these challenges may well be a new generation of analog computers. (soft upbeat music) - One of the most important problems humans have faced for millennia is predicting the tides. Napoleon and his men nearly died crossing the Red Sea due to a miscalculation of the rising tide. And sailors routinely needed to know the tides to bring their ships into port without running aground. Most coastal locations on earth experience two high and two low tides per day, but their exact timing varies as does their magnitude. And this is partly caused by local factors like the depth of the sea bed and the shape of the shoreline. In the late 1700s, to describe the tidal flow of the oceans, Pierre-Simon Laplace derived a set of complicated differential equations. They had no analytical solution, so at that time they were basically useless. But in the process of deriving his equations, Laplace made a key finding. Tides are driven at only a few specific astronomical frequencies, including the moon, the sun, and the eccentricity of the lunar orbit. Each one of these factors contributes a sine wave of a particular amplitude and phase to the total tide curve. If someone could figure out how to correctly combine these frequency components, well the tides could finally be predicted. It took nearly a century. But in the 1860s, William Thompson, later Lord Kelvin, took up the challenge. Having completed several voyages to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable, he developed a fascination with the sea. And subsequently, he threw his full scientific effort into measuring and predicting the tides. Tide gauges at that time used a buoy to record the height of the sea onto a paper roll. Kelvin set out to determine how sine waves, with the frequencies identified by Laplace, could add together to produce the observed tidal curve. The key was to apply the work of French mathematician, Joseph Fourier, who had shown how to decompose any function into a sum of sine waves. Most English scientists were skeptical of the work, but Thompson was enthralled by it. His first paper, published at 17, was a defense of Fourier. While it was straightforward to apply Fourier's analysis to tidal curves, the computation required was enormous. First, divide the tide curve up into short time intervals. And for each interval, multiply the tide level by a sine wave with the frequency of interest. Add up the area of all these rectangles, and divide by the total time. And this gives you a single coefficient, the amplitude of the sine wave with this frequency. Then you have to repeat the process for a cosine function with the same frequency. Kelvin found that to make accurate predictions, he actually needed 10 different frequency components. So that is a lot of multiplication and addition to characterize the tides at just one location. For each additional location, you have to perform this analysis all over again. And this is only half the problem. Once you have the amplitudes and phases of the sine functions, you have to add them up to predict the future tides. - Lord Kelvin spent years analyzing and predicting tides by hand. Then he had a stroke of inspiration. Could you design a machine to carry out these calculations automatically? In Kelvin's words to ""substitute brass for brains,"" the resulting analog computers were in use for nearly a century. They even played a critical role in the outcome of World War II. - Kelvin started with the problem of prediction, adding the sine waves together, given you know their amplitudes and phases. He knew he could create sinusoidal motion with a device called a scotch yoke. It extracts one dimension from uniform circular motion. But to make a tide prediction, he needed a way to combine 10 sine waves together. He needed a mechanical analog for addition. Stuck on this problem in 1872, Kelvin boarded a train for a meeting with the main sponsor of his tidal research, the British Association. On the train, Kelvin bumped into a friend, inventor Beauchamp Tower, to whom he explained his dilemma. Towers suggested he used Wheatstone's plan of a chain passing around a number of pulleys. And this was exactly the addition mechanism Kelvin was looking for. By attaching a pulley to each scotch yoke and running a weighted cord around them, he could mechanically add all of their contributions at once. He scribbled down the entire plan for this predictor machine by the end of the train ride. He pitched it to the British Association, and secured funding to build it all before he returned home. If you knew the relative contributions of different frequency components, Kelvin now had a machine to automate the tedious task of predicting future tides. This was a great leap forward. Four hours of cranking the handle yielded a full year of tidal predictions. But for many years, the harder half of the problem was still done by hand, breaking apart an existing tide curve into its component frequencies. To automate this step, Kelvin needed a machine capable of multiplying the tide curve times the sine wave, and then taking its integral. What would such a device even look like? With his older brother, James Thompson, Kelvin came up with a mechanical integrator. It consists of a ball on a rotating disk. Due to the rotation of the disk, the further the ball is from the center, the faster it spins. If the ball is at the very center of the disk, it doesn't turn at all. And if it's on the left side, it turns in the opposite direction. Now the motion of the ball is converted into an output via a roller, which moves a pen up or down on the output graph paper. So the way it works is you trace the function you want to integrate with a stylus, and the stylus controls the position of the ball on the disk and hence its speed of rotation. This is transferred through the roller to the output, which plots the integral of the original function. Now to decompose a tide curve, we don't just wanna integrate the function. We first wanna multiply it by a sine wave of a particular frequency. And the way to do this is to make the disk rotate back and forth at that specific frequency. Now the rotation of the ball depends not only on where it is on the disk, but also on how the disc is turning at an instant. You trace the tide curve with the stylus, which moves the ball back and forth on the oscillating disk, and the roller sums up the integral of the tide curve times the sine wave. Simply divide by the total time to get the coefficient. Several of these ball and disk integrators can be connected in parallel with each disk oscillating at a different frequency to calculate the coefficients for multiple frequency components at the same time. Kelvin's analog computers revolutionized our ability to predict tides. Tidal curves from anywhere in the world could be turned into a set of sinusoidal coefficients using the ball and disk harmonic analyzer. And the resulting sinusoids could be added together to predict the future tides using his scotch yoke pulley machine. - [Derek] Kelvin's harmonic analyzers were the basis for a landmark analog computer called the differential analyzer, and his tide predicting machines were used well into the 1960s. In fact, they were later overhauled to include 26 frequency components and used to plan the allied invasion on D-Day. - The Germans expected any invasion to come at high tide to minimize the time Allied soldiers would be exposed on the beaches. So they installed millions of obstacles that would be underwater by mid tide, many with explosive mines attached. But the allies spotted the obstacles and change tack. Instead, they plan to begin the invasion at low tide. This would allow demolition teams to first clear channels through the obstacles, then the main forces could come through those gaps as the water rose. This would also give landing craft enough time to depart without getting beached. The low water times were different at the five landing beaches by over an hour, so the invasion times were staggered according to the tide predictions. - This wasn't the only use of analog computers in World War II. Dive bomber aircraft would plummet out of the sky directly toward their targets at up to an 80 degree angle, and their rapid descents made them very difficult to shoot down. So the U.S. began searching for devices to automatically aim guns at dive bombers. Most of the proposed solutions fell into one of two categories. Some were analog machines like Lord Kelvin's. Others were essentially fast calculators. Mechanical calculating machines like the abacus had been around for millennia, but they were far too slow to respond to dive bombers. These new calculating machines sped things up by using electrical pulses. The committee considered naming these devices after the pulses they used. But member George Stibitz proposed a more general name: digital, because these machines operated on numbers themselves or digits. And this is the origin of the term digital computer. But digital would have to wait. Of all the proposals and innovative analog machine from David Parkinson won out. At Bell Labs in New York, Parkinson had been working on a device to chart telephone data called an automatic level recorder. It used a variable resistor called a potentiometer to control the motion of a pen. One night, after hearing reports of the harrowing allied evacuation of Dunkirk, Parkinson had a dream that he was on the front lines. (radio tatters) (mystical music) (gun firing) ""I found myself in a gun pit with an anti-aircraft gun crew. ""A gun there was firing occasionally, ""and the impressive thing was that every shot ""brought down an airplane. ""After three or four shots, ""one of the men in the crew smiled at me ""and beckoned me to come closer to the gun. ""When I drew near, ""he pointed to the exposed end of the left trunnion. ""Mounted there was the control potentiometer ""of my level recorder."" When he woke up, Parkinson realized the device he was building to control a pen could be scaled up to control an anti-aircraft gun. He shared this idea with his supervisor, and after receiving approval from the military, they set out to make Parkinson's dream a reality. Researchers at Bell Labs had recently invented an analog electrical device called an operational amplifier or op-amp. It could perform mathematical operations with voltages, like addition and multiplication. They used these op-amps to create an analog computer that could solve the ballistics equations for anti-aircraft guns. Using radar and optical sites to obtain the speed, altitude and direction of enemy planes, the M9 Gun Director, as the computer was called, could rapidly calculate the correct trajectory and few setting. Potentiometers were used to ascertain the direction the gun was pointing. This was not the first electric analog computer, but it was an important one. In World War I, It took an average of 17,000 rounds to take down a single airplane. In 1943, after the invention of the M9, it took an average of only 90. During the war, the U.S. invested big in analog computers. If you break down their total military budget, the third largest single expense was the development and production of an incredibly complex mechanical analog computer called the Norden bombsight. Unfortunately, they didn't get their money's worth. - Designed by the eccentric Dutch engineer, Carl Norden, the Norden bombsight was built to enable high precision airborne bombing. It implemented 64 different simultaneous algorithms, including one that compensated for the rotation of the earth as the bomb fell. (bomb exploding) The Norden was one of the most closely guarded secrets of the war. To prevent the technology from falling into enemy hands, American bombardiers carried handguns specifically to destroy it in the event of a crash. But despite its hype and funding, the Norden didn't work as advertised. With over 2,000 fine parts, it required extreme precision to manufacture. The problem with analog computers is that the physical device is a model for the real world. So any inaccuracy in the components translates into inaccuracy of the computation. And since there will always be some slop in the connections between parts, if you run the same calculation twice, you won't get the exact same answer. In the American campaign against Japan, bomber crews using the bombsite were unable to destroy critical Japanese war infrastructure. And ultimately, the U.S. abandoned its precision bombing approach, and instead blanketed whole Japanese cities in napalm. As the war progressed, digital computers gained traction. The digital and electronic Colossus machines of Bletchley Park in the UK were critical to breaking German codes. In the United States, the military invested in an enormously complex and expensive digital machine, known as ENIAC. It was designed to speed up the calculation of land artillery firing tables. At the time, these were computed using differential analyzers, the analog mechanical computers based on Kelvin's harmonic analyzer. Although not finished until after the war, ENIAC demonstrated the power of digital computers. It's considered by many to be the first modern computer. - What really opened the door to this digital revolution was the discovery made by Claude Shannon in his 1936 master's thesis. He showed that any numerical operation can be carried out using the basic building blocks of Boolean algebra: Two values, true or false, also notated as one or zero, and three operations and, or, and not. This makes digital computers the ideal versatile computing machines. In contrast, each analog computer is an analog for only one type of problem. Furthermore, since digital computers operate on ones and zeros, they are more resilient in the face of noise. It would take a large error to mistake a one for a zero or vice versa. Whereas, even small errors in analog computers can grow and ultimately swamp the signal. So these days, everything is digital. Our phones, computers, and internet data centers, even TV and radio is now being broadcast as digital. The advantages are obvious. Since digital devices operate on symbols, usually zeros and ones, they provide exact answers. And repeat the calculation, and you get the same result. They are robust to noise. Plus, since only a few components are required to perform virtually any computation, those components have been miniaturized and optimized, making digital computers the ideal universal computing machines. So you would think analog computers would be long gone, a relic of the distant past. But, analog may now be making a comeback. There are startups actively working on analog computers. Why is this happening? What could be the benefit of analog? I wanted to put all of these into one video. But the story is too good to bury 20 minutes in, so that is coming up in part two.

D6mVeaeAMes,11:43,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person mrs. Anton and in this video we're going to be talking about comments but actually not just comments all of the comments from our solar system combined into one let's find out what happens and welcome to what the man [Music] so this right here is actually one of the most famous comments out there the Halley's Comet this particular object if you were to take a look at it and compare it to our planet Earth is not very big it's actually relatively small but nevertheless its size if I were to actually select it here is about five and a half kilometers in radius so it's definitely large enough to destroy civilizations on a planet but not large enough to destroy the whole planet but what if we were to combine all the comets from the solar system into one how big of a comet would you actually get now to explain this or to answer this question I actually have to first talk about where comets come from and to do this we're going to zoom out of here as a matter of fact well it was not quite a lot to a region of space known as the Oort cloud this is a original space named after a Danish astronomer Jan Oort who along with another Strummer actually predicted it many many many many years ago so right here we are at a distance of approximately a thousand astronomical units this is thousand times the distance of Earth from the Sun and so here this is sort of where you expect the Comets to reside but this region is actually very very large you actually have to zoom out quite a lot before you reach the end of or it's cloud a more visual representation of this is actually right here and you can see that this is kind of where we were thousands au and this is kind of where it ends over a hundred thousand or possibly even five hundred thousand au which is just over three light-years away from our Sun as a matter of fact or it's cloud is actually beyond where Voyager 1 spacecraft is right now the farthest craft from our planet and it's basically a region of space that we have never visited never really seen any objects from except for the ones that come to the inner solar system so it's a very hypothetical region but we're almost certain that it exists and we're almost certain that it has a lot of comets out there we usually see the effects or the results of these comets on planets like for example this is the shoemaker-levy comet that actually crashed into Jupiter many years ago and we even got to record this event but what's interesting about the Oracle in general is that it actually has a tremendous amount of these comets just kind of Lane waiting for them to be disturbed by something so they can actually come closer to our planet Earth or to the inner solar system so we are almost certain that a vast majority of these comets are actually the leftovers from early solar system development and were most likely kicked out of the inner solar system by these guys by larger objects like Jupiter Saturn that as they were musical being created through a lot of material into the outer solar system into the Oort cloud and so one of these comments most likely are made up of various ices so basically things like methane water ethane are carbon monoxide and even of various hydrogen cyanide components so this is another famous Comet swift-tuttle and these comets are essentially at least for the most part relatively large so we expect that with the trillion of these comments to be more than a kilometer in size and quite a few of them possibly a billion of them to be large enough to cause major destruction now what if we were to actually measure the entire mass of the entire Oort cloud and then try to add it into one massive object so first of all is actually two parts of Oort cloud one of them is a kind of a disc that's known as the inner Oort cloud and that one is a relatively small but then there is this really really massive sphere around our Sun basically this very very large but I guess somewhat invisible spherical volume around our Sun and around our solar system that's known as the Oort cloud main Oort cloud and that particular region is definitely going to be massive if you were to actually combine everything from it into one object so let's try this let's do a little bit of simple math here and imagine what this object would look like if it was right next to our planet Earth right here so first of all we're going to use Halley's Comet as a kind of a prototype so let's go back to Halley's Comet which is right here and let's place it around our planet Earth so here's Halley's Comet it's about five just over five kilometers in radius and what we're going to do is basically use the scientific assumption that there's about a trillion of such objects out there possibly a little bit less but let's just say that it's a trillion so what we're going to do is we're going to multiply the mass here by a trillion trillion has 12 zeros so we're going to add 12 right here and see how big of an object would get so first of all maybe we want to actually move Halley's Comet a little bit farther away from Earth just because we want to actually create an object that we can compare to earth and we're going to keep everything here as it is right now so the density and the radius and the mass is going to be the same until we actually change this part so it's going to have 26 zeros after four and as soon as I press ENTER here is the object that you get look at that that is the sort of the upper limit of all of the comets as one and it's still named Halley now as you can see it's basically a large water bowl because for the most part it's just ices that have not melted but if I actually just let it run for a few seconds here for a few minutes earth will most likely start falling into it its current mass and this is once again an upper mass of this object is about 70 masses of Earth now this is actually what we used to think some scientists actually even thought that it was about 300 masses of Earth some even thought it was about 2% of the entire solar system which is about 600 masses of Earth but a more recent analysis actually lower this to about 5 masses of Earth so we don't really exactly know how much of mass there is out there but we think that it's definitely at least 5 so this is the lower limit of all of the comets together and so this is how much of stuff there is out there in all its cloud in this these little pieces of about 5 to 6 kilometers in radius that we call comets but there is like a trillion of them out there there's a lot of them and they always have a high chance of coming into our inner solar system because commutation aliy they're actually not that strongly attached to our Sun so a passing object like a star nearby or even a rogue planet can actually dislodge them and have them then fall into our inner solar system and possibly collide with planets like Earth now we're going to basically just let this run for a little bit and see what happens but as you can see there is definitely a lot of mass out there so Oort cloud is surprisingly oh wow that's that's a crazy explosion or Scott is surprisingly very very massive it's anywhere from five to maybe several hundred masses of Earth in mass and contains a lot of really cool material that used to be in the inner solar system but then basically got thrown out by Jupiter by Saturn by a lot of other planets including earth as these planets were forming so in other words if you were to combine the entire Oort cloud into one single object you will get a pretty large planet you will get a planet that's at least five masses of Earth up to maybe even 300 masses of Earth which is basically the mass of Jupiter Olin although it's definitely a really interesting hypothetical scenario to explore and hopefully one day we'll actually be able to travel faster than we travel right now so we can actually go and visit some of those objects and maybe even analyze them and study them in a little bit more detail because as of now even objects like Voyager right here will actually take hundreds of years to even reach worse clouds going to be a very long time before we can even potentially approach an object with a craft that we have right now and by then this little guy is going to run out of power so we don't really have any means of studying these objects because the only way we actually get to study these objects is when they approach the inner solar system because they were dislodged by something out there in the Oort cloud but remember it's so far away that it would take them thousands of years to even get close to our planet Earth so it's not a very effective way of studying these unusual objects and because these objects are basically just leftovers from the creation of the solar system at least one of them might actually answer quite a lot of questions about not only the origin of our solar system and our planet Earth but also origin of life maybe deep inside these objects there is actually the answer to the question of where life on Earth came from but until we actually get to study these we won't really know anyway that's all I wanted to show you in this video and hopefully now you know a little bit more about comets the Oort cloud and the entire mass of the old cloud combined into one single object and if you've enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe share this with someone who enjoys watching space videos and click that Bell button to be notified about videos in the future I'll see you guys tomorrow come back tomorrow to learn something else about space you may have not known and spaced out and as always Hawaii and before we finish let's see what this would look like as an object 300 masses of Earth as a single bowl of water so that means I have to change this from about 26 to about 27 and okay this humongous bowl known as Hale is now 2.2 masses of Jupiter that is a tremendously large object as a matter of fact I think earth could easily orbit around it look at that this is beautiful and I think this spot right there that's actually from previous earth colliding with it I don't know why it's spinning so fast oh that's kind of interesting [Music] [Music]
_w8jyWRq_2c,10:01,en,true,true,ok,,"hello wonderful person mrs. Anton and in this video we're going to be talking about a discovery of an unusual star known as hypervelocity star that seems to originate from somewhere in our galaxy where we didn't really expect it to come from so let's talk a little bit more about this and welcome to other math now what you seen right here is a really awesome simulation made from the data collected by the gaia telescope and the simulation was created by the european space agency to kind of represent what are all the stars in the vicinity of our planet will actually look like or move to where they'll move to in the next few millions of years this is actually a super realistic simulation and it allows us to not just track the stars and their future location but also track unusual stars and because of this data and because of this simulation esa was able to discover several really really cool star is known as hypervelocity stars and in this video right here you're going to actually see some of these stars being tracked by a guy telescope and what's interesting is that their velocity suddenly changes dramatically allowing them to escape our galaxy and so we've discovered roughly around 30 of these stars so far and for the most part I found them armed leaving our galaxy for the most part some of them are actually coming from the center of our galaxy and that in itself allows us to explain their origin relatively easy so here for example you can see that some are actually coming from other galaxies but some of them are escaping our own galaxy coming from the regions of space where we know that they could have been kicked out by for example a supernova if there are two stars and one goes supernova it might get enough velocity to get kicked out or they might have gotten kicked out by the central supermassive black hole Sagittarius a star in the middle of the galaxy but we've just discovered at least one of these unusual stars that seems to be escaping from a completely different region of galaxy where there is really nothing there's no supernova there there also seems to be no supermassive black holes suggesting that something really unusual kicked it out now we're going to use this relatively rough simulation in universe and works with the Milky Way beam right here and the star that was covered right here so it's approximately or actually just over 40,000 light-years away from our own planet and it's already quite far away from the Milky Way and it's moving away from it at a speed of approximately 568 kilometers per second meaning that it's moving at faster than the speed of stars that are inside the galaxy approximately double the speed actually I believe our own Sun moves at just half of that just over 280 kilometers per second now this star is known as let most hbs1 and it's a very interesting star even ignoring the fact that it's moving so fast it's interesting because it's somewhat sun-like but a lot more massive it's I believe about 8.3 masses of the Sun which means that it's not going to live as long but still it's very sun-like it's relatively young and also very very high metallicity higher than the Sun now if you don't know what mr. lucid means it's essentially things that are not hydrogen not helium that are present in this star system now what it usually refers to is how likely is this star going to have planets okay not just planets terrestrial planets so terrestrial planets are made from stuff that's metallic that's not hydrogen not helium and because this particular star is higher in methylated in our Sun there's a very high chance that it might actually have quite a lot of rocky planets orbiting around it that are well similar to earth similar to Mercury Mars and Venus now these rocky planets are currently very hypothetical but their chance of existing and the fact that this star is very similar to our Sun is actually pretty high so for all we know this particular star system might have its own little worlds but maybe even life there and it gets to enjoy this beautiful view of the Milky Way from a distance now what else do we know about the stars so we know it moves really fast it's very similar to the Sun but more metallic and to some extent we know where it came from and essentially we know its origin in terms of the location but we don't really know what made it go that fast so we know that it came from a region that's not in the center here it actually came from one of the arms and if we try to trace this and we try to see where it really came from what we realize is that there seems to be nothing there but it's also region that's covered by a lot of dust so we don't really know exactly what's happening there and so because of this scientists started to speculate so what could have given it this boost why is it moving so fast we expect this to move that fast if there's a supernova or if there's a black hole very very massive black hole and so because of this there are two main four positions now first one is that maybe there is actually a globular cluster there similar to you for example this right here m13 so these clusters are all over the place there's actually a lot of them they often contain a lot of stars of thousands and millions of stars and we believe that many of them actually contain the elusive intermediate black holes so that could have actually been enough to kick the star out if there is a globular cluster here and if it has an intermediate black hole inside it may have provided enough boost to give the star a velocity of 568 km/s but we don't really know this because we don't see it just yet at the same time if it was a smaller cluster like for example if it was actually just a few stars there and they were really massive stars more massive than eight masses of the Sun possibly several dozens or even hundreds of masses of the Sun and if the star pass relatively close to them it also may have had enough chance to get this slingshot maneuver and get boosted out of the galaxy so in other words if this particular star passed close to let's just say this star it may have received enough velocity to get slingshot out of this globular cluster and then move really really really fast across the skies out of the galaxy so that's another potential explanation if it passed by many many very massive stars approximately hundred or even more masses of the Sun but once again because we know that it actually came from this region right here known as the normal arm and we don't seem to see anything there no global requesters as of yet and also no any kind of black holes or supernova we're still kind of in the dark about what really happened there and so for this reason this unusual sun-like star known as a la most hbs1 is definitely one of the most curious objects were discovered at least this year in 2019 it's probably going to be one of the most interesting hypervelocity stars in general simply because we can't explain why it's moving that fast but also because of the way that it's very similar to the Sun relatively young and of course very very high metallicity we don't expect these stars to have such high metallicity meaning that this star was produced after a supernova a very massive star and also potentially has many terrestrial planets there so this could be a really cool object to actually take a look at in more detail one day but unfortunately since we don't really know much else about these hypervelocity stars and because we've only discovered like 30 of them as of today with the first one only being discovered something like 14 years ago in 2005 this it's by itself is already a pretty cool discovery so these hypervelocity stars will hopefully one day be a little bit more clear to us we'll hopefully know a little bit more about them but for now all we know is that there is a lot of these stars flying around the universe coming in and leaving our galaxy at all times and many of them came from galaxies really really far away and luckily for us the Gaia mission that's tracking all of this and is making a really detailed map of nearby space will help us find more of these stars and hopefully help us explain their origin and of course the origin of the universe itself for now do I think that's all I'm going to say in this video because there is unfortunately nothing else to add other than it's a cool discovery on that note thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you learn something more about the universe and of course about these unusual stars known as hypervelocity stars and in the next videos we're going to explore some other topics you may have not known about so do subscribe if you still haven't and maybe even share this video with someone who is learn about space through simulations and video games I'll see you guys tomorrow space out and as always away [Music] you you"
vx_s4H30qmA,14:56,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person this is anton and today we're going to be talking about this upcoming nasa mission that you can actually apply for yourself that is going to try to simulate living on mars for approximately one year and just like so many other missions previously this one is going to involve quite a lot of scientific experiments and quite a lot of really interesting observations but what makes this mission a little bit different is the fact that it's going to be produced entirely by 3d printing the actual colony itself or the actual habitat which makes this a little bit different but today i wanted to discuss the mission how you can apply for it but more importantly some of the previous missions and some of the previous discoveries or actually more appropriately some of the previous failures and what we've learned from all of this in the last few decades let's start right here in case you want to apply for this this mission is known as chapea and the application for this is in the description below but as you can probably tell the deadline is actually pretty close and just like some of the previous nasa missions that involved habitats and people living in those habitats they are looking for some really specific types of people with really specific skills but you don't have to be a scientist you don't really have to be some sort of a phd or an engineer with famous inventions you just have to be a normal person that fits their requirements and so this is why this is one of those interesting missions anyone can technically become a part of it and you get to live in this really interesting 3d printed habitat that one day might be on mars so do check out the application in the description below but before you go let's talk about these habitats and let's talk about some of the previous missions and failures so the purpose of this mission just like with all of the previous missions is of course to try to establish all the necessary requirements for humans to eventually survive in outer space living in some sort of a colony remote colony on mars or of course any other moon or maybe even some other planet somewhere out there but these types of living habitats have been attempted many times in the past trying to create these earth-like environments has actually been a goal for many different missions and not just for space missions as of today there are close to about 50 different attempts by different organizations by different societies and sometimes even by just regular people to create enclosed habitats in order to study the effects of these habitats on humans and of course on other things in those habitats as a matter of fact some of the results from these miniaturized experiments allowed us to apply some of the lessons from these experiments to some of the bigger structures on the planet including for example bigger office spaces and buildings in general that normally have their own circulation their own air and water distribution systems and allow humans to live in these buildings all of this is a result of all our different experiments in the past and of course airplanes and even shopping malls have actually benefited from a lot of these experiments but trying to conduct something like this is not very easy you have to account for a lot of different factors it's not just food it's not just atmosphere it's not just the fact that you have to support the humans living there or provide the necessary atmosphere for a lot of other species to survive there are a lot of other factors a lot of unpredictable factors including human psychology that actually plays a much bigger role and has unfortunately caused a lot of these experiments to fail but all this really started back in the 60s during the space race when nasa created what's known as the nasa living pod an experiment trying to see how long the humans could actually survive in these conditions and here they essentially took four early astronauts and locked them inside the container you see right here and this represented a very interesting sealed environment where a lot of things like oxygen and food were actually recycled and produced from the outputs from the humans essentially the excrement and the carbon dioxide was reused to produce more things and pretty quickly the scientists here discovered that first of all you had to retrain the astronauts entirely a lot of the things that they took for granted such as breathing or going to the bathroom now became essential for their survival in order for them to actually produce certain elements they had to do something else and so every single action of the astronauts was absolutely essential for their survival while also helping the scientists realize that none of this was actually that sustainable within about four months the conditions became almost completely unlivable the astronauts were not feeling well they had a lot of headaches they had a lot of nausea and they also contaminated a lot of the circulation with things like fingernails hair and so on and so because of this the experiment had to be finished early and so these early experiments kind of showed the scientists that there was just a lot of unpredictability a lot of it was in regards to human behavior with human factors usually sort of causing the experiment to fail but it wasn't just nasa doing this one of the most famous such experiments was by the famous jacusto you can learn more about this from cousteau.org the link in the description below but essentially this was an underwater habitat known as conshelf that was supposed to be completely independent of anything and the people living in those habitats would be able to live and function possibly even living in extreme depths of about 300 meters or even deeper although obviously in this particular case the main research was more about the oceans and living and surviving deep in the oceans as opposed to trying to survive in for example outer space or on a different planet but in the 70s there was an entire explosion of ideas in regards to these self-sustainable habitats one of the most famous ones was actually a house located in london created by a collective known as street farm with the main architect in this case being graham kane and this is what the house store looked like would this be a kind of a prototype for what they refer to as the eco home the house itself would recycle everything the humans would provide and would then use all this material to in some sense feed itself so pretty much all the energy all the resources would be produced from all the waste from human beings living inside the house you can learn more about this from the article i'm posting in the description below but to date the most famous such experiment that did not involve any major organization was the biosphere 2 experiment that was recently immortalized in the film known as spaceship earth the film that you can actually find on netflix and that's pretty interesting in describing how the community here decided to create biosphere 2. the huge facility created in arizona for approximately 150 million dollars where several individuals lived for approximately two years but even though the individuals were pretty easygoing the problems started to accelerate pretty quickly and the mission eventually failed so for example they started to run out of oxygen pretty quickly the amount of carbon dioxide started to accumulate a lot too they also started having a lot of different problems with getting enough calories from food and they also started to have a lot of different infestations of different insects for example cockroaches who seem to be thriving in these conditions and so within just a few months of living there a lot of them started to lose a lot of weight many of them started to become really depressed and had a lot of mood swings and eventually they split into two groups one group wanting to continue the experiment the way it was and one group wanting to actually bring some things from the outside which eventually led to the failure of the experiment but all of these experiments all these failures really helped us understand one major thing the biggest element in every single case was the humans humans introduced the most instability in every single experiment something that was not predictable something that could not be calculated in advance and something that was only revealed after you put those humans into those systems as a matter of fact if you were to remove the humans from those experiments for example biosphere the actual system seems to survive just fine and so even though in case of biosphere there were a lot of different factors including things like certain oxygen breathing bacteria that seem to have stolen a lot of breathing oxygen from people at the end of the day a lot of this was still related to what humans did and how humans were taking care of certain plants and how they were performing agricultural activities inside the biosphere itself now this facility still exists and you can actually see it in arizona and people still actually live on this farm as well today this is still known as the synergia range but if you get to watch the film i mentioned and also if you get to hear or read some of their thoughts they do mention how this was a completely transformative experience it helped them realize how completely interconnected we are with everything around us every single activity every single action they did would somehow reflect on something in the biosphere itself and eventually their activity sort of caused the biosphere to collapse to some extent it didn't obviously get destroyed but it was no longer habitable for humans which of course is also a very important lesson for what we're doing to the planet but that's beside the point and so after a few decades i mean you'd assume that maybe we've actually understood what's happening here and how to fix these problems but the reality is that a few dozen more of these experiments have been conducted by nasa and some other organizations such as for example with the mars society in the last few decades with the purpose of course being the colony on mars but although we keep learning new lessons a lot of these missions seem to fail for one reason or another normally unpredictable reasons related to humans for example back in 2018 another one of these missions known as high seas where several people would live in remote conditions in hawaii representing a somewhat similar conditions to i guess surface of mars unfortunately ended up failing completely after six years the story itself is pretty interesting and it's sort of worth exploring but in short all of this was a result of group dynamics a result of very stressful environment for humans living in those conditions combined with unpredictable events and breaking down of communication so all of this all these human dynamics caused the mission to fail once again you can explore more about this in one of the articles in the description and the purpose of this mission was specifically to explore the dynamics of different groups learning about stress management learning about morale learning about dynamics when it comes to intercultural groups but nasa clearly did not expect the experiment to go so wrong so quick and so i guess one of the natural questions here is are we just wasting money is there any point in conducting these experiments more well the whole purpose of the experiment is to actually help us learn about ourselves and how we interact in these closed environments as a matter of fact whatever happened during high seas is very very close to what could potentially happen if we live on mars if we live somewhere on the moon or for when we find ourselves living in small communities somewhere on a colony maybe somewhere else and there's actually a really big lesson from all of this the lesson being that no matter how much you predict and how much you try to anticipate everything it is absolutely impossible to predict these variabilities coming from the human behavior itself even with the most robust psychological screening unfortunately things just do not always work out and so even though you can have perfect candidates that seem to have perfect resumes something will still go wrong somewhere which is exactly why nasa wants to conduct even more of these experiments in order for us to even see if we're going to be able to live in a small colony working together for years and years and years and actually even right now there are several major experiments already going on in different locations on the planet these are normally referred to as mars analog habitat and you can also learn more about them in the link in the description but honestly it's not always that you get a chance to try to live in one of these conditions yourself as a matter of fact this is an opportunity to not just learn about human dynamics but also learn about your own weaknesses and how you operate in these conditions now i know from personal experience having lived on a sailboat for quite a while with a small group of people it's not very easy it's actually pretty challenging i know that i right now at least would probably not survive in these conditions for a very long time i would definitely get grumpy and not so wonderful after a few months because of this i'm personally not going to be applying but you should at least if you're interested in this and if you have time and so do check out the application available on nasa website and for all we know maybe you'll be one of the selected participants like i mentioned before the selection criteria here allow for pretty much most people to participate but they are looking for a specific mixture of people what this mixture is i don't really know nevertheless i'm super excited to see how this experiment goes and sometime next year we'll probably be talking about some of the successes or possibly some of the failures coming from this experiment as well mostly because i'm super fascinated with the idea of human psychology in various conditions and also in various habitats we know that even nasa astronauts sometimes break down and have serious problems in space and so learning more about this is super interesting anyway on that note check out all the relevant links in the description below subscribe if you haven't and share this with someone who loves learning about space and sciences or someone who might want to apply to this particular mission maybe support this channel on patreon by joining a channel

ogDBFD7tr90,13:30,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person this is anton and today we're going to be talking about what seems to be the creation of the most accurate clock on the planet the clock that's so accurate that even since the beginning of the universe it would have only shifted by a few milliseconds which implies that it would take around a trillion years for this clock to be wrong by one second but just in general let's also talk about the history of time keeping and how our timekeeping devices advanced throughout the last few centuries and today we believe that keeping track of time or time keeping most likely began with the egyptians and the babylonians around 5 000 years ago babylonians for example had this really complex system of keeping track of time which was mostly used for all sorts of communal activities all sorts of public events and to essentially schedule different things that related around trade and also harvesting and planting of various crops and most of this was usually done using sundials like this one right here this is from egypt which would essentially create a shadow that could then be used to track time in the day which was also connected to a larger calendar which normally was some sort of a really complex star chart that involved observing the stars and measuring various dates seasons and so on but since sundials only worked in the morning the night alternative for this was the so-called water clock this usually used the dripping water to try to mark certain periods of time in order to measure times at night as well but as you can probably imagine all of this was extremely inaccurate and it was relatively easy to make a mistake or possibly even have some sort of a major miscalculation in the dates time and so on i mean for example if you suddenly broke your water clock or if suddenly your sundial was stolen or disappeared well that means that you couldn't really keep track of time for quite a while now at some point the egyptians and some other civilizations also started using the so-called hourglass which was actually a very accurate way of keeping track of certain periods of time but eventually even this wasn't really enough but unfortunately for centuries there really wasn't any new technology coming up until about early 1200s in 13th century in this particular place right here known as the dunstable priory in england we have the appearance of what seems to be the first ever mechanical clock this was a weight driven clock and were most likely used in this particular church to keep track of time when for example the preacher was delivering a sermon or during the practice of the choir you can actually learn more about all of this in the article i'm posting in the description below but within only a few decades after this as the trade around europe started to pick up the need for timekeeping and the need for precise timekeeping especially for for example keeping your shop open or for conducting other types of trades created a major need for new types of clocks and a lot of accurate measurements at this point a lot of new clocks started to be developed by various artisans and i think one of the most famous ones was probably this one right here in prague but interestingly because all of them operated with a relatively similar mechanism where they actually used to strike a bell to announce certain time the word for these devices became clocker which is basically latin for a bell and that's of course why we call clocks clocks today it's just because of the historical reference but up until mid 1600s all of the clocks were relatively inaccurate still as a matter of fact most of them would have a few minutes of difference after a single day and so the need for precision became quite important especially as we started to colonize and explore the world using relatively complex pathways across the oceans in this case clocks became paramount for navigation and for accuracy of knowing exactly where you were now around 1637 the famous galileo galilei proposed the first ever pendulum clock which was physically created by another astronomer christian higgins only a few decades later in 1656 and one of the reasons it was actually the astronomers that created these relatively accurate clocks was because they were having trouble keeping track of objects in the night skies every single night if you didn't have an accurate clock you would actually not know what you were looking at the night before and you would have trouble finding the same star mostly because it was very difficult to know back then what time it was at night and so both astronomers and actually several other astronomers spent a lot of time actually decades trying to develop a relatively accurate system of keeping track of time at night and they essentially succeeded with the invention of the first pendulum clocks which actually were relatively accurate up until approximately 150 years ago so these were used for several hundred years and so interestingly was on christmas day of 1656 when the first accurate pendulum clock became available to all of the astronomers and this of course was also the beginning of the age of precise observations of motions of different stars comets and so on across the night skies and what's really amazing about this new discovery is that it was essentially at least 100 and even up to a thousand times more accurate than any previous clock before that so this was an extremely extremely groundbreaking discovery for that particular age and so even though before that the accuracy was about 15 minutes per day basically a typical clock would either gain or lose about 15 minutes per day we now had an accuracy that was around one minute per week and that's actually a huge improvement especially for astronomy and eventually as clocks became more popular and also as they became in some sense more attractive they even would eventually turn into a required furniture in pretty much most of the houses and that's of course how pretty much everyone back in the days used to have these so called grandfather clocks but with time the mechanisms became more and more complex and by early 1900s we had a very very accurate mechanism including this brilliant mechanism known as escapement and even certain parts that used partial vacuum and so by 1900s pretty much most of the astronomical observatories had these really advanced pendulum clocks that had extremely complex parts on the inside but around the same time actually even prior to this we also started to discover other properties of other things other materials in this case we discovered that so-called crystals of quartz were actually able to oscillate at an extremely precise frequency that could be used for certain things for example timekeeping and so in 1927 the bell telephone laboratories in canada built the first official crystal quartz clock that was able to use this extremely new by then technology these crystal clocks were extremely accurate the era here was roughly around one second every two years or so and so this clock was already accurate enough to be used by pretty much all of the industries on the planet but interestingly this technology didn't really last long within only a decade we've discovered that we can also use atoms and so in this picture right here you see jack perry on the left and louise essen on the right standing in front of the first ever cesium-133 atomic clock the clock that's based on an extremely precise oscillation of cesium-133 atom that we've been able to calculate extremely accurate and that has also since become essentially a standard for a lot of different measurements for example the second today is described in terms of the oscillations of this particular atom and what's even more interesting is that cesium oscillations are even used to calculate some of the other units including meter the unit of length so in that sense this is an extremely important discovery and helped us improve the accuracy of a load of different measurements around the planet that number or that oscillation is the number you see on the screen and this is the number that we use for a lot of calculations today as a matter of fact most atomic clocks today use cesium 133 and this number to calculate all of the time around the planet every satellite that we use every atomic clock on the planet they all use this standard and though since then we've had propositions of for example using pulsars or neutron stars for more precise time measurements because in some sense they can actually be more precise than the cedium clock and at least one paper even proposed using this white dwarf as the most accurate optical clock it would still be much easier for us to just use cesium 133 mostly because it's readily available and also because it's a lot easier to keep track of any kind of errors with a white dwarf especially if it's just a single object it means that at some point when the earth is spinning around it would be invisible to some of the observers on the planet and so in that sense it's not really the best solution but the atomic clocks are still not perfectly accurate mostly because when the light is emitted by the atom itself it causes the atom to recoil just slightly and because of this it introduces tiny shifts of atoms and thus introduces these tiny mistakes that can end up with time but what's the approximate accuracy here well every few million years we expect an atomic clock to lose approximately one second and the thing is the scientists have been trying to improve all of this by first of all cooling down season atoms and making them stop moving so much but that's still not really that accurate for scientific purposes and in this case the scientists were finally able to solve this issue by introducing a little bit of quantum mechanics and so the scientists behind the paper you can find in the description below we're able to create a really accurate cesium 133 clock by entangling several different atoms using lasers and using the phenomenon known as quantum entanglement in other words they were able to connect several atoms and make them act as one and because of this the tiny shifts of individual atoms can now become kind of averaged out thus removing any errors that we previously had and this new clock is basically the most accurate clock ever made if it was operating since the beginning of the universe so basically for the past 14 billion years he would have only made approximately 0.1 second mistake so that's about 100 milliseconds per 13 to maybe 14 billion years and what's more is that this is a scalable technique so in other words by adding even more atoms and by adding more entanglement we can make this clock even more accurate and so in that sense this is actually a completely new technique that allows us to measure time with such extreme precision that it would also allow us to recalculate a lot of different units and create some of the most precise measurements humanity has ever had this of course includes things like seconds but also things like units of measurements of length of weight and of course of energy so in that sense the accuracy here is completely mind-blowing but what's interesting is that all these advances for the most part have really been done to help us with different astronomical problems even though all of this started with for example heightens and galileo who essentially just wanted to be able to observe comets and stars better now we need this precision to be able to know exactly where satellites are in space mostly because all of our satellite technology depends on extremely extremely precise atomic locks without having this precision we actually will not be able to communicate or use any satellites and this is of course yet another thing that astronomy is good for it introduces these incredible concepts and incredible new techniques that are then used by everyone around the planet but i guess for now that's kind of all i wanted to mention in this video i wanted to take you on this historical trip and explain to you how humanity used to keep track of time and what we can do now with these new extremely precise clocks but we'll actually continue this and talk a little bit more about all of this in one of the future videos so make sure to subscribe share this with someone who was learning about space and sciences come up tomorrow to learn something else and support a channel on patreon

pQT3_Bjo5Ns,13:27,en,true,true,ok,,how wonderful person this is Anton and today we're going to be discussing the idea of artificial photosynthesis something that the Nature has been trying to evolve and improve for billions of years and something that in the last few decades we humans have improved even more and specifically I wanted to focus on at least a few recent studies where the scientists have found brilliant ways of essentially allowing photosynthetic plants to grow in complete darkness overall improving the efficiency of growth as well and even created what the scientists refer to as cyborg bacteria that are able to photosynthesize a lot more efficiently than pretty much anything else in natural existence but this idea of artificial photosynthesis is obviously not new it's been in existence for quite a long time and has been used for a lot of different reasons and so in this video I only wanted to focus on some of these recent discoveries and only some of these reasons but we'll be discussing more advancements and more discoveries in some of the future videos as well and so in photosynthesis what is it in a nutshell I mean in case you completely forgot based on the biology in high school well as a broad definition photosynthesis involves two different steps there is the light sensitive step and in this case it's usually the proton or the hydrogen from water being captured into the next cycle with the oxygen being released as a byproduct although even here it is light dependent reactions can vary quite a lot depending on the organism and do involve a lot of extra steps followed by the second light independent reaction which normally captures CO2 and by using the previously captured hydrogen then starts to produce all kinds of sugars and all kinds of molecules that represent food for a typical organism and obviously even here there is quite a lot of diversity and quite a lot of very complex reactions as well in more chemical terms there are two different half reactions there's the oxidation reaction followed by the reduction reaction and both of them are essential for the production of fuel afterwards and typically the light is used to photo oxidize water molecules to release oxygen and to produce hydrogen protons whereas the second stage we very often referred to as the Kelvin cycle does not actually need any light and here it converts carbon dioxide into different types of glucose different types of sugars and basically food for the plant or for the organism that's photosynthesizing and when it comes to ideas of artificial photosynthesis here the scientists normally focus on one of these two steps either to improve the light reaction or to improve the formation of glucose and various types of sugars although ultimately the idea is to try to combine both and to make both of them way more efficient and that's because despite billions of years of evolution unfortunately photosynthesis has not reached the most efficient levels as a matter of fact it is not efficient at all with some plants being more efficient than other plants and some organisms only being able to success will use approximately one percent of the solar power would the average be in about three to six percent and that's not a lot at all because even your typical solar panel right here will usually have efficiency of at least six percent up to about twenty percent with some of the lab devices often even having 40 efficiency and if this has more efficiency than what Nature has created in billions of years there's definitely some room for improvement and there are actually quite a lot of inefficiency when it comes to photosynthesis just to give you one example one of them is because of the Evolution for example we know that when early bacteria was still evolved in photosynthesis early on such as the purple bacteria there was not a lot of oxygen on the planet this is also when the extremely important protein known as rubisco that's usually responsible for the second step of photosynthesis in most life was also evolved as well you can learn a little bit more about this from one of the older videos in the description and so back then the oxygen was not actually affecting anything in the chemical reaction but as oxygen became more prominent especially after the great oxygenation event it started to interfere with the chemical reactions that were already established inside various photosynthetic organisms and so for example right here where rubisco is supposed to capture carbon dioxide sometimes it can also grab Oxygen by mistake and when it does so instead of producing helpful sugars it can sometimes end up producing glycolic acid or different types of glycolates and this ends up in dramatically reducing the efficiency of this process because glycolys are sort of seen as a kind of a toxic waste and so some of the mechanism has to then be used to dismantle the glycoids and to even release some of the materials along with carbon dioxide that could be used otherwise this ends up reducing that second step by at least 40 efficiency and that's of course just a natural reaction and a natural process that happens in everything on Earth and so in the last years some of the studies have tried to solve this by even Resort according to certain ideas from the genetic engineering but that's just one of many deficiencies of photosynthesis here's another one sometimes when the sunlight gets way too strong the plant needs to cool down in order to avoid damage and this process of light quenching can take minutes or even hours in order to turn off the primary Machinery responsible for the light based reactions but if suddenly there are more clouds covering the skies and the conditions improve it will still take at least a few minutes to possibly a few hours to then restart everything once again reducing the efficiency quite dramatically and so there are some really impressive projects out there such as this one right here known as the C4 rice project that essentially tried to find Solutions in bypassing soundly's natural reactions and thus improving the overall growth of plants and the overall photosynthesis now we're not really going to be talking about this particular project just yet but in a nutshell it's an attempt to genetically modify rice plants to to bypass some of these natural photorespiration responses in order to improve the efficiency of rice by at least 50 percent and because rice is the biggest staple food on the planet it will thus improve the efficiency of growth of rice for a lot of different communities on the planet this project is currently actually doing really well and so I wanted to dedicate some of the future videos to explain exactly what they're doing but the whole point I'm trying to make is that naturally photosynthesis is actually not efficient at all and it does have a lot of issues to deal with because of the way that our planet evolved in the last few billions of years but in this two new studies that I'm going to be discussing right now the scientists were able to improve each one of these individual steps making each one of them more efficient and in theory applying both of them to maybe any plant out there with one of these projects already winning one of the awards from NASA itself and the first Advance is visible behind me this is the image of what the scientists refer to as a cyborg bacteria bacteria that was engineered to become even more efficient at capturing sunlight Now by default some bacteria have a very interesting natural defense where if certain metals are introduced into the environment the alternates have a Metals into various sulfides expressing them on their surface and so in this case when the scientists grew these bacteria by introducing tiny particles of cadmium these bacteria started to produce cadmium sulfide crystals only outside of their bodies the particles that are known to be photosensitive and as a result this doesn't just turn these bacteria into photosynthetic bacteria but it actually makes them extremely efficient at producing acetic acid vinegar from nothing but CO2 Water and Light and the efficiency here was extremely high approximately 80 percent which is roughly around twice as high as the most efficient solar panel and over 10 times more efficient than any known plant and so in this case the cyborg bacteria were essentially perfect for Gen rating huge amounts of acetate which though might not sound very useful is actually useful for several different species but that's of course just one example of producing acetic acids but this particular research connects very well with the next research that was actually only released a few weeks ago in this case the scientists were able to create a kind of a hybrid system where they first created an electrolysis system with solar panels electrolyzing water to create oxygen and acetate but then grew various types of plants and various types of mushrooms and algae in complete darkness producing food completely independent of any solar activity or any light or to rephrase this they were able to grow several species by feeding it acetate allowing these organisms to grow in complete darkness something that didn't just work but turned out to be even more efficient than growing the same plants under light conditions discovering that several kinds of mushrooms were actually thriving in these conditions and normally these mushrooms and these fungi would usually work in collaboration with another plant but also discovering several types of algae such as this one right here known as clamindu munas which normally only work in sunlight but in this case we're growing just fine in complete darkness in flasks of acetate and as you can see right here the right flask seems to have way more algae than the left flask the right flask was actually grown in the dark the left one was grown in regular conditions but when applied to various more complex plants such as lettuce it would only grow to a certain point suggesting that sunlight was still required for certain reactions but the scientists are not certain which ones suggesting that a solution here can be either some kind of a genetic engineering technique or maybe a different chemical can be synthesized and used alongside acetate but which one we're not really certain yet but the important Discovery here once again is that all of this was way more efficient than using natural photosynthesis under natural light conditions and more importantly all this could then be combined with previously mentioned cyborg bacteria to First produce huge amounts of acetate and to then use this to produce large amounts of biomass that will require this acetate to function because each of these two important steps of photosynthesis were individually improved in each of these studies in each of these papers and note the second paper in this case relied on the solar power to essentially produce the acetate it would be a lot more efficient if they replace this with that cyborg bacteria had previously mentioned and in this case this study has already made it to phase 2 of NASA investigation to produce food in space or on any future Colony we might have somewhere outside of planet Earth implying of course that these are extremely important discoveries and if they're successful or in other words if these studies reach a point where they actually become a functional technology it's quite possible that all this will then make its way to our daily lives right here on on planet Earth providing food security for a lot of different communities out there and even allowing sound crops to grow completely independently of sunlight in complete darkness and as we've experienced this year food security is still a huge issue on the planet even today more so than ever before so these particular studies are actually extremely important for the future of humanity as a whole but these are just some of the discoveries from the last few years we'll talk about more discoveries in some of the future videos so make sure

VztSdwYPFCE,7:40,en,false,true,ok,,"Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Steve Seitz and Chuck Dyer used view morphing to  digitally reveal a side of the Mona Lisa we've never seen before. What it would look like if she stared directly at us. That's her but it seems a bit unfamiliar. I mean, there is only one iconic view of the Mona Lisa. There's only one physical object you can look at to say that you saw the Mona Lisa with your own eyes. Photographs exist. There are copies you can also look at. There are forgeries, there are parodies but the true original Mona Lisa is in the Louvre. That's where it is. But where is this video? Seriously, where is this video? I mean, it's on your screen right now but it's also on a lot of other screens. Where's the original? Well, it's stored on YouTube servers and the original export is on my hard drive but those are just instructions for making the video. This video is anywhere. Every stream, every viewing of this video is, as Bill Thompson would say, ""a digital simulacrum of something that has no original"". So, how does a museum curator  or an archaeologist deal with this? Well, they are rethinking curating. I mean, take a look at this sculpture. ""The distance from this sentence to your eye is my sculpture."" That's pretty cool, but how do you put something like that in a museum? This sculpture and this video can be endlessly copied and every version is made out of different stuff at different times, a bit like your body. There's an identity crisis going on. As I discussed before, every few years nearly all of your atoms are replaced. Old ones leave, new ones come in. Where is the original you? Like this video, you are really just the result of a set of instructions being followed. And in our cases, interestingly,  those instructions are kind of forgeries. 'The $12 Million Stuffed Shark' is a great book about the art world. It mentions that, at one point in history, there were 600 Rembrandt's hanging in museums and 350 Rembrandt's in private collections. The only problem is Rembrandt scholars say that Rembrandt only ever made 320 paintings. Mistaken identity, forgeries and phonies have been around for a long time. In 1496 a young Michelangelo, the same Michelangelo that painted this, forged a statue. He treated the statue with acid to make it look not like his own work but like the work of ancient Greeks or Romans, so he could sell it for more money. But really, what's wrong with a forgery? I mean, sure, supporting forgeries is like supporting plagiarism but as far as intrinsic aesthetic properties go, what's the difference? Whether painted by Da Vinci, or a dog, or copied perfectly by a robot, wouldn't the Mona Lisa smile just as mysteriously and cooly? Well, here's the thing. We feel like the original, the Mona Lisa Da Vinci originally made, has an aura about it. As Richard Wiseman discussed in Quirkology - a great book - psychologist Paul Rosen once studied just how obsessed we are with relics, things important merely because of their auras. He found that people were more willing to wear a sweater that had been dropped in dog poop than they were to wear a sweater they had been told what was once owned by a mass murderer. We are influenced by auras. Right now, I am in Mougin. The city in southeastern France where Picasso died. On one occasion Picasso refused to sign a painting he knew he had painted, saying ""I can paint a fake Picasso just like anybody else."" You can disown your own paintings and you can disown your children but you can claim to have created your own paintings, but can you really claim to have created your own children? Let's explore a metaphor. Your mother is a 3D printer that printed you. But hold on, your parents conceived you and curated you, cared for you. But the actual blueprints that made you were outside of their conscious control. Your blueprint is a forgery. It has been copied, replicated, over and over again, ever since the very first group of molecules were arranged in a way that automatically replicated billions and billions of years ago. It's not a perfect forgery. Changes occur every time, making successive copies a little bit different. But 99.9 percent of your DNA isn't different from anyone else's. Now, you might say, but wait, Michael, we all look so different. Kind of. But that's also because your brain is particularly good at recognizing differences amongst things that you are familiar with. It's called the cross-race effect and it's the reason new twins you've never met before look totally the same, until you get used to them. It's the reason people from a culture you're not use to tend to be more difficult to distinguish. And the reason, say, a big group of black labs you've never met before all kind of look like the same black lab. We all have a common descendant, a common person our DNA has been replicated from over and over again, making us, in a funny way, a big bunch of forgeries. Go back 50 forgeries ago, 50 generations ago, and that's enough to connect every single human living on Earth. I've said this before, you are at least 50th cousins with everyone else living on the planet today. But we can go back further than that, as Guy Murchie famously did. You see, animal populations, and even molecule populations, experience replication variation and selective pressures, which means you are trillionth cousins with all life on Earth and, technically speaking, quadrillionth cousins with water and trees and rocks. It's a beautiful notion but it's anything but new. The word 'human' comes from a word for soil. And compare the Hebrew word for 'ground' with their name for the first man. You are quadrillionth cousins with dirt, with rocks, with trees, with plastic, with the very clothing you are wearing right now. So whether you're fighting with a stranger in a bar or stubbing your toe on a rock, it's all just a family squabble. And as always, thanks for watching. Oh, hey, you're still there. This is great because I have some really cool news. Vsauce was just nominated for a Webby, in the news and information category. It's a really big honor and I want to thank you guys for making this possible. You can be a Vsaucer in a whole new way now by voting for Vsauce in the Webby's. Just follow the link at the top of this video's description. All the nominees, by the way, are great. It's great that the universe has these channels, so check all them out. And as always, thanks for watching."
y9c8oZ49pFc,7:20,en,false,true,ok,,"Where is the darkest part of a shadow? I mean the obvious answer seems to be, right in the middle. If you look closely at a shadow, as you move the object away from the wall, you notice that the shadow gets a bit fuzzy. So clearly, the edges are lighter. Now, we know that light bends around corners, that's a phenomenon call ""diffraction"". So, is it diffraction that's responsible for the fuzzy edges of shadows? Actually?... No. The reason that shadows have fuzzy edges, is because most light sources like the sun are not perfectly point objects. So, light from one edge of the sun is coming at a very slightly different angle from light from the other edge of the sun, and that's what gives us these fuzzy edges. It's not diffraction. But diffraction can play a significant role in shadows, and in fact, it was the cause of a massive debate, about 200 years ago... In 1818, the French Academy sponsored a competition to try to find the best explanation of diffraction. And Augustine Fresnel entered this competition with the suggestion that light is a wave phenomenon. And just like any ordinary wave, it bends as it passes around an obstacle. But one of the judges was Simeon Poisson, a harsh critic of the wave theory. He much preferred Newton's idea that light was a stream of particles. And to show just how ridiculous the wave theory was, He showed that Fresnel's theory would predict a bright spot in the shadow, right in the middle of the shadow behind a circular object. That there would be a spot, almost as bright as if the object wasn't there at all. And he thought this was absurd. But my question is, Does it exist? Is the brightest part of a shadow really in the middle? To find out, we're gonna have to do the experiment. So first I had to find some circular obstacles. I selected spheres instead. I got some marbles and some small spherical magnets. Then for a powerful light source and a large distance to the screen, I selected a lecture theater with a projector. Now the first thing we're gonna need is a small aperture for the light to pass through. So I'm gonna poke a hole in this card with a screw. It's important to have a small aperture because you want the light to be in phase. And that should work if it's all coming out of this small little aperture. But when I put a sphere in front of it ... Alright, somebody hit the lights. Here we go... I can't see a bright spot. I can't really see anything. So next I tried a cellphone flashlight, putting a marble in front of that And again I could see nothing. I don't see anything in the middle. The idea with Poisson's spot is that light should diffract around a circular object, or a sphere, And because the center of the shadow is equidistant from all the edges of that obstacle, all of the light should constructively interfere at that point creating that bright spot. So next I tried an overhead projector. I tried a string of the small spherical magnets. It's weird. Like, I feel like I can see it. Derek: Do you think you can see a bright spot in the middle of that bottom one?       Girl: No. Derek: No? I feel like in the very center of each one, I can see a bright spot. I don't know. My eyes are just totally going nuts up here. Like, staring at shadows and trying to see what we want. But this one is opaque. It's nice and speherical. Set it down... And if I adjust the focus... You can see there's a bright spot right in the middle of that marble. So the spot looks pretty good, but something about it didn't sit right with me. And you know, when you think something is true, you really should try as hard as you can to disprove it. What if you used your fingers to kind of  make the edges less spherical? Yeah You see now that, that I think is concerning, that fact we can still see a bit of spot even though it looks like you're... Right? How is the light getting through and getting there? What was really happening, was light was coming up from from the base of this overhead projector, bouncing off this lens, back onto the top of the marble, and then back up through this lens, and onto the wall. So finally I decided to use a laser I resisted doing this earlier because in 1818 they didn't have lasers. In fact, Poisson didn't do the experiment. He didn't think that you needed to. The idea of a bright spot in the middle of a shadow was just so ridiculous. And Fresnel didn't do the experiment either. But one of the other judges by the name of Arago decided to actually do the experiment. And when he did it, he saw something similar to what I saw. So here I was using the laser through a diverging lens. And then that beam was shone onto a marble resting on top of a loop of tape. So you can see on the wall, basically exactly what you'd expect. Just a shadow of the marble But when you turn the lights off... there it is... A bright spot right in the middle of that shadow. So the brightest part of a shadow is, in the middle! As long as it's the shadow of a circular or spherical object. Now this spot is sometimes called Arago's spot because he did the experiment and found it. Sometime's it's called Fresnel's birght spot because it was his theory. But pretty frequently, it's referred to as Poisson's spot. A harsh reminder that it's not only your great achievements, but also your greatest mistakes that can be named after you. We don't see Poisson's spot in our day-to-day lives for many reasons, one of which is that most objects are not prefect circles. Plus if they have any surface roughness, really any at all, that will completely wash out Poisson's spot. And finally, most light sources are not coherent. That is, the waves are not coming all in phase: peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs. You might think you could never see Poisson's spot under ordinary conditions. But you can... What you need to do is look at a diffuse source of bright light like a fluorescent tube or the blue sky. You should see some small light specks drifting around your visual field. Now those are caused by floaters. Little particles actually drifting around inside your eyeball. And they can be all sorts of different shapes, but some of them are spheres. And so they cast a shadow on the back of your retina. And right in the middle of that shadow is Poisson's bright spot. And that is what demonstrated that light really is a wave phenomenon. And you don't even have to take my word for it. You can see it with your very own eyes."
cHEOsKddURQ,13:54,en,false,true,ok,,"Vaping is kind of amazing â€“ finallyÂ  a less bad alternative to smoking. It delivers one of the most popularÂ  drugs in the world: Nicotine. It may improve your attention, concentration, memory, reaction time and endurance. ItÂ  can reduce anxiety and stress and help you relax and enhance your mood. Nicotine alsoÂ  suppresses hunger, making it easier to maintain or lose weight. And it is simply fun to putÂ  a thing in your mouth and get a little kick. Compared to other stimulants,Â  nicotine's effect doesn't come at the same high price for our bodies. ItÂ  is also crystal clear that vaping is way, way less harmful than smoking. Smoking delivers, well, hot smoke and extremely toxic particlesÂ  directly into your lungs, causing serious damage all over your body right away. But we willÂ  purely focus on nicotine vapes in this video. Ok sure, nicotine is one ofÂ the  most addictive substancesÂ Â we know. But vaping on its own seems kindaÂ  ok. So is it really that bad if you do it? Well, we should find out quickly. While in theÂ  West smoking is slowly falling out of fashion, especially among teens vaping has become aÂ  growing epidemic. In 2023, in the UK 20% of children have tried vaping at least once. InÂ  the US 8% of all students are currently vaping regularly. One in four of them do it daily,Â  and almost all of them use vapes with flavours. So how does vaping work andÂ  what does it do to your body? How does Vaping work? A vape is basically a small tank of liquid,Â  heated up by a metallic coil, that vaporises it. The major ingredient in most vapeÂ  juice is propylene glycol and glycerol, the main chemicals in smoke machines, whichÂ  are also used in countless chemical processes. From food like candy and baking mixes, toÂ  cosmetics, paints or plastics. Then there are the nicotine salts containing the magicÂ  and dozens of different flavour molecules. When you pull on a vape, the metal coil heats upÂ  and turns the liquid into the vapor you inhale. Vapor sounds kind of nice, harmless and pleasant.Â  But vapes donâ€™t produce actual vapor, but a heated mist of aerosol. A warm sticky substanceÂ  made out of large molecules and microscopic particles mixed with air. The best thing toÂ  compare it to is inhaling warm body spray. When you take a hit, billions of aerosolÂ  particles cover your mouth and tongue making you taste pleasant stuff, and enterÂ  into your lungs. They reach your alveoli, little air sacs where the breathingÂ  happens. Here the nicotine passes into your bloodstream and is transported intoÂ  your brain to cause all the pleasant effects. And here the complications begin. What is actually in your vape? The scary answer is that we donâ€™t really know. Studies found that vape liquids can beÂ  thousands of very different mixes of many dozens of substances. The majority wereÂ  not even mentioned on the label. This seems almost unbelievable, but the vaping industryÂ  is much less regulated than youâ€™d think. We know that many official substancesÂ  in vapes are technically safe. Kinda. Theyâ€™re used in cosmetics, medicine orÂ  food and have been extensively tested. Most are safe to eat or put on your skin. ButÂ  that is not the same as breathing them in. Cinnamaldehyde, found in cinnamon oil, killsÂ  cells and causes genetic damage when inhaled. Benzaldehyde found in almonds or apples has aÂ  fruity taste and is common in cherry, berry, chocolate or mint flavoured vapes. As aÂ  gas, it irritates the respiratory tract. What is worse is that we donâ€™t know what manyÂ  substances in vape juice do if heated up. The longer you inhale and the hotter the coilÂ  gets, the more chemicals in the juice change. Molecules merge or break down, creatingÂ  new compounds with unknown consequences. When propylene glycol andÂ  glycerol are heated too much, they decompose and turn into harmfulÂ  molecules. This can happen when the liquid runs out or the coil gets too hot. YouÂ  will probably notice this because your vape will taste weird or burned â€“ if thisÂ  happens you should stop right away. And it gets worse. When the metal coil isÂ  heated up, it releases metal particles. Studies found aluminium, boron, calcium,Â  iron, copper, magnesium, zinc, lead, chromium, nickel, and manganese in the vapor â€“ all ofÂ  which vary from really bad news to straight up toxic and can cause lung irritation,Â  chronic bronchitis and shortness of breath in the short term. Nickel canÂ  also cause cancer when breathed in. All of these mystery substancesÂ  also interact with each other in new and exciting ways. InÂ  bad ways? We donâ€™t know yet. What do we know about theÂ  health effects of vaping? What Does Vaping DO in Your Body? The elephant in the room is that we donâ€™t knowÂ  exactly how bad vaping is, since it has only been around for about ten years. Also, mostÂ  studies on health effects in humans focused on smokers who switched to vapes. We do know forÂ  sure that smoking is orders of magnitudes more harmful. Switching to vaping will reduce yourÂ  risks of disease massively. If you smoke, please switch to vaping. But theseÂ  studies also muddy the water a bit. What if you never smoked and started to vape? InÂ  the short term, a significant portion of vapers develop poor breathing symptoms: coughing,Â  extra mucus production, shortness of breath, wheezing, throat and chest pain. But theÂ  truth is we simply donâ€™t know what will happen in the long term. The first largerÂ  scale study on vaping with non-smokers only started in 2024 â€“ it will take yearsÂ  before we can say anything with confidence. We can make careful assumptionsÂ  but take them with a grain of salt. Your lungs are made from very sensitive tissueÂ  and were never meant to deal with trillions of aerosols, chemicals and metals. What goes intoÂ  your lungs generally stays in them forever, which is why smokersâ€™ lungs are dark and dirty. It seems that vaping activates the immuneÂ  system, which tries to clean up the aerosols. This causes inflammation and fluid seepsÂ  into the lungs, while the cells guarding their entry produce extra mucus you haveÂ  to cough out. Some of them may even die. Vaping also may cause stress all over your body: it may increase your heart rate and bloodÂ  pressure, lower blood oxygen or stiffen and clog up your blood vessels. It may createÂ  oxidative stress, which has all sorts of bad effects on your organs and may potentiallyÂ  cause many different diseases over time. Does this increase your risk of strokes, heartÂ  diseases, lung diseases or cause cancer? Again, we donâ€™t know. Maybe it causes damage, butÂ  something else will kill you before vaping does. Maybe it will make you sick.Â  But all we have right now is: Maybe. We are conducting one of the largestÂ  medical experiments in history. If you are vaping youâ€™re a test subject. Too Much of the Wonder Drug What is new about vaping is the sheerÂ  amount of nicotine it delivers into your system. For most people it is kind ofÂ  hard to smoke 20+ cigarettes a day because smoking is pretty harsh. As vaping isÂ  less aggressive and doesnâ€™t smell bad, you can do it inside and constantly, for hours.Â  It is easy to go through an entire vape a day. They showerÂ your brain in  extremely high nicotine doses, which makes them extremely addictive. For teens this may be very bad. During yourÂ  teenage years your brain is developing and your nicotine receptors are especiallyÂ  active. They are directly linked with your reward system and thus, how youÂ  feel about yourself and your life. Nicotine may change brain development byÂ  overstimulating the nicotine receptors. Again, the science is prettyÂ  annoying here with loads of caveats. Nicotine in teens has beenÂ  linked to cognitive deficits, hyperactivity, reduced impulse control,Â  deficits in attention and cognition, and mood disorders. But there is a chickenÂ  and egg problem â€“ did nicotine cause this or are people with a tendency for emotionalÂ  dysregulation just more likely to use it? There have been studies that suggest nicotineÂ  is a gateway drug making it more likely to develop other addictions. But this has beenÂ  largely rejected. Instead it seems people who are generally more likely to take risks, tendÂ  to do more risky things. They are more likely to get addicted to smoking, alcohol or cannabis,Â  hard drugs or gambling. This doesnâ€™t make vaping any less addictive, it just means that it isÂ  probably not the cause of other addictions. Where the science is pretty solid, isÂ  that most people have a bad time when quitting nicotine. Nicotine is one ofÂ  the most addictive substances we know and comes with a wide range of reallyÂ  unpleasant physical withdrawal symptoms. You can be on edge and experienceÂ  intense craving for nicotine, unpleasant mood swings and anxiety.Â  You can have difficulty sleeping, fatigue and headaches and trouble concentrating.Â  It can be harder to experience joy and to deal with stress. And it can make depressionÂ  worse. Without nicotine your suppressed appetite comes back and since some peopleÂ  compensate by eating more, they put on weight. All of this makes quitting nicotine extremelyÂ  hard. On top comes psychological addiction, that can be intense, since vapingÂ  is extremely habit forming. The good news is that these symptoms areÂ  entirely reversible. It takes about 72 hours for the nicotine to leave your bodyÂ  and the worst withdrawal symptoms fade out or stop entirely in a few weeks. Conclusion The problem with vaping is that it isÂ  too good. It tastes great, itâ€™s pleasant and stimulating. But it also superchargesÂ  nicotine and makes it even more addictive. Every smoker who switches from cigarettesÂ  to vapes is a win for global health. But this is where the benefits end. Vaping hasÂ  already hooked a significant portion of the younger generations to nicotineÂ  and that is really bad news. It is kind of unfair to expect young peopleÂ  to resist vaping by providing information about how bad it is or might be. Scaring peopleÂ  straight is a bad strategy. If you are addicted to nicotine, you use it to fight stress. And ifÂ  you stress someone out by telling them that the thing they use to fight stress is bad, they do theÂ  thing, to fight the stress you are causing them. Basically, humans developed a new way to make oneÂ  of the most addictive substances, that was on the decline, attractive to millions of teens by makingÂ  it taste like bubblegum. Vaping is still very new â€“ and we still have a chance to curb this newÂ  global addiction before it gets out of control. Making decisions that affect your healthÂ  is hard enough, but itâ€™s impossible to base them on rational ground if you donâ€™tÂ  have reliable information available. Algorithms are constantly working behind theÂ  scenes to decide which information to show you, and alarmist headlines get amplified overÂ  straightforward reporting. But Ground News, the sponsor of this video, can give you backÂ  a feeling of independence. We have a personal connection to them: our founder Philipp wasÂ  immensely bored while getting chemotherapy a few years back and decided to read allÂ  German newspapers, even the ones he hated, front to back every day. He was shockedÂ  to see the bias he suspected confirmed, and all the stories each side decided not toÂ  report on. This experiment lead him to Ground News. In a nutshell, the app and website gatherÂ  the worlds news in one place so you can compare coverage, see the biggerÂ  picture and make informed decisions. For example, recently a study was releasedÂ  claiming that in England, â€œ1 million who never smoked started vaping.â€ Ground News givesÂ  me perspective: this was barely reported by 20 sources, a small number in comparison toÂ  hundreds of headlines on the FDAâ€™s first authorization of vaping products three years ago,Â  back when some even cited benefits for smokers. This way you can compare different perspectives inÂ  one place, see how the story and coverage change and also reference the original story study toÂ  make sure no nuance is lost. You also get a sense of the bigger picture and how much weight a storyÂ  really carries to tell apart reason from racket. Go to ground.news/nutshell to give itÂ  a try.

qSwwD9OQEsY,10:13,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person this is anton and today we're going to be talking about dark matter and the potential collisions of this matter with planet earth and more specifically we're going to be investigating potential craters created on a planet earth that could have been produced by the mysterious dark matter all of which is based on the upcoming study that investigates one of the creators that has very unusual origins let's talk about this and welcome to what the math in the last few months several different papers and also several different pictures confirmed the existence of dark matter even further the more recent analysis was actually focusing on these so-called lensing effects and several papers were able to show that the only way to produce these lensing effects the way that we see them is if there's unusual chunks of matter somewhere out there in the universe but because there are no actual chunks of matter visible in those pictures the only explanation here is of course the mysterious dark matter in other words this unusual presence unusual mass that seems to be all over the universe but obviously even today we have no idea what it is what it's made out of but there are quite a lot of theories investigating different potential detections and also origins of this mysterious matter some of these theories involve all kinds of exotic particles but this particular theory that i wanted to take a look at today focuses on dark matter being made out of so-called strange matter also known as strange star matter but to try to understand all this let's quickly take a look at what we are made of here's a typical person inside this person we'll find all sorts of different cells inside each of these cells will find all sorts of different protons and neutrons and electrons but inside each of these protons and neutrons we'll also find what's known as quarks which as of today is the smallest particle we've ever discovered here's a summary of different types of quarks and also so-called leptons we've discovered with pretty much most of the known matter to us consisting of this stuff right here in the left column but you can obviously make particles out of other types of quarks and in one of the future videos we're going to be discussing various types of exotic matter scientists have been able to create by combining different types of quarks and making these different types of i guess you can call them atoms that do not actually exist in nature at least today they might have existed long long time ago when the universe was much hotter and had very different density but today we don't really think it's possible for these particles to naturally be created except of course if they're inside the neutron star and so at least one theory of dark matter presents the dark matter as a kind of a strange matter consisting of equal parts of up down quarks and also strange quirks so essentially instead of having something like this with two up and one down quark these types of particles would contain a mixture of up down and also strange and charm quarks these so called strangelets could even grow in size by combining with regular matter as you see in this illustration and could hypothetically become very large and very massive but they can also interact with regular matter through various types of magnetic interactions and potentially even lead to relatively large explosions although to be honest a lot of scientists are still not entirely sure that the strange matter as is known or the strangelets can actually exist at all but if they could exist and if they did interact with matter on earth we could potentially discover their effects here by looking at different types of craters which also brings me to a video that was made last year where i did discuss the idea of well could dark matter have killed someone and can it actually be dangerous and it seems like the scientists behind this paper do make a suggestion that if strange matter is dark matter then it could be dangerous and they even present several examples where at least one fatality might have been caused by this unusual matter so let's discuss this according to the scientists behind this paper every year there's at least one report of an unusual crater being created somewhere on the planet that was not produced by a meteorite and that was not a naturally produced explosion of any kind this right here is one such example from nicaragua in 2015 there was a report from abc news right here that suggested an explosion on the beach that was not produced by any known chemical reaction but most interestingly in 2016 there was a fatality reported in india that did produce a crater and even injured three other people but there was no report of anything being recovered there was no chemical reaction that could have caused this and this explosion seems to have occurred when something from space did collide with planet earth but nothing physical was reported to be found and to try to figure out if this could have been caused by some kind of strange matter the scientists behind this paper combined their simulations and their actual theory including the simulations of what would happen if this unusual strange matter collided with matter on earth with the actual physical excavation and analysis of different types of rocks inside one such crater that was created in ireland in 1985 and the crater itself was produced in 1985 and witnessed by several people walking their dogs there was no meteorite recovered there was nothing actually even falling to the ground but interestingly the explosion itself created the effects that were observed very deep in the ground in other words the rocks and even the material underneath the rocks was affected by whatever caused this explosion but unlike a meteorite collision first of all nothing was seen falling to the ground no fragments of any kind were recovered there was no chemical reaction involved no residue of any explosives and most importantly they could not see any damage attributed to pressure of something hitting the ground from top at very high velocities as if something just exploded but did not produce enough pressure to crush the rocks underneath and interestingly even the granite rocks recovered from approximately 5 meters in depth or 15 feet in depth were shattered into little pieces and to scientists behind this paper this suggested that whatever piece of matter hit the planet that day was extremely dense and had extremely high nuclear matter density somewhat similar to what a lot of the predictions of the so-called strange matter indicate similar to the so-called quark matter or strange matter but this was probably a very very tiny piece only about 10 kilograms or about 20 pounds in mass and this would make this object extremely extremely tiny and though theoretically it could also obviously be a piece of for example neutronium matter or neutron star matter or even a tiny tiny black hole when it comes to black holes we know that small black holes like this would have actually disappeared a long time ago their actual life span would only be about 150 years and neutron star matter would not really be stable enough to travel by itself unless it's inside a neutron star and so according to these scientists behind this paper the only thing that could have collided with planet earth was probably some sort of a strange matter which they also believe is the only thing that could potentially produce all of the effects observed in this crater and this of course presents us somewhat interesting but also somewhat scary scenario because every year there's a report of a non-meteorite creator and at least one such crater in india resulted in someone's death so if all of these events are connected and the scientists behind this paper are onto something then it means that we need to start taking dark matter a little bit more seriously and start investigating if it actually does pose threat to humans here on earth but it's very important to understand that this is just a hypothesis for now there is really not enough proof to suggest if this is actually what happened there there is also no proof to suggest that this is what happened in india so a lot more investigations and a lot more analysis is needed before we can definitively say that at least once a year chunks of dark matter do fall on the planet and create explosions large enough to potentially hurt people on the more positive side of course this also creates an opportunity for us to potentially recover some this matter one day and maybe even use it for some sort of an energy production in other words there is a possibility if this is of course true that this type of matter could create a new way for us to produce energy that could even allow us to travel across the entire universe and maybe even create technology that we can't even think of right now but unfortunately for now that's all i wanted to talk about once there is more confirmations or disapproval of this idea or once more papers come out discussing other non-meteorite creators and have other explanations for them i'll make sure to fold this up with another video but until then thank you for watching subscribe if you still haven't

hPNkiD9DKS0,8:21,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person this is Anton and welcome to the system of Jupiter into this video we're going to be talking about the July 2018 discovery of twelve new moons around Jupiter that now put the number of total moons here to 79 let's talk about this and welcome to what the math so first of all Jupiter already had a lot of moons to begin with as a matter of fact Jupiter currently stands as the record holder for the number of moons in the system these moons can actually be divided into basically different types of moons and as you can see they all have very different orbits but for the most part you have these so-called classical moons or so-called Jovian moons which are really just four moons Io Europa Ganymede and Callisto you can kind of see them right in the center and they all have relatively circular orbits with very very specific patterns as well there's also so-called regular moons these are moons that are normally orbiting in the same direction as Jupiter and also have the relatively circular or low inclined orbits select for example there's a lot of regular orbits you can regular moons you can see in the middle here such as Mattie's taping and so on and there is also irregular moons which is pretty much everything else this is one of such moons that has no actual name yet this is another one and the what makes to me regular is basically that they have sort of their own orbit and that's mostly because they were more likely captured asteroids or captured objects from asteroid belt or basically from outside of solar system these moons however the regular moons and the classical moons were most likely made when Jupiter was being created as well so what have we discovered well we actually discovered twelve objects and eleven of these are referred to as normal moons well let me let me just kind of demonstrate to you by placing them in the random orbits around Jupiter and this is going to be at a distance where each orbit will take approximately two years so we have this is all randomly generated for now but basically here are some of them we're just going to place them right here and here is a visual representation of these moons I actually had to give them the direction opposite of the spin of Jupiter because that's kind of how they move the this is sort of yet another type of moons around Jupiter that have basically orbit in a direction opposite of everything else in the inner region of Jupiter now we've discovered these moons while basically looking for planet nine in other words these Sciences trying to find Planet nine accidentally discovered these twelve moons but that's not all of them two of them were a little bit closer to Jupiter and they're actually all quite small only a few kilometers in diameter but two of them actually had orbits very similar to other moons of Jupiter so in other words these are actually regular moons of Jupiter but then one of them was very very strange they actually referred to it as an odd ball and this odd ball even has a name now they gave it a name of valley tudo which I believe is a Roman god of Hygiene now I'm going to show you how Valley to the orbits so remember these moons are orbiting in clockwise direction but now a tudo which I just placed right here has an orbit of about 1.5 years around Jupiter and it actually orbits against the floor pretty much every other moon is going this way but it's going with the flow it's actually going in the same direction as everything else in the inner system of Jupiter and this is really unusual also it's sizes about one kilometer in diameter making this probably the smallest moon of Jupiter so it's really shouldn't be that circular I think it's circular because I accidentally generated a circular object here it's most likely more asteroid shaped now this unusual moon has a lot of questions to answer this for example why is it that it's actually on such an unusual path compared to other moons and what actually created this moon its inclination is relatively similar to other objects in in the inner Jupiter system meaning that it most likely was formed when the planet was formed as well so this is probably a very ancient moon yet it's moving all by itself really very tiny piece against fall so some suggestion indicate that maybe this was actually a result of a collision early on in in the Jupiter system where it basically generated this fragment and then it kind of flew to the outskirts of the Jupiter system and now it orbits here for the rest of its time but this suggests that maybe there are other objects similar to that we will discover in the future if this was a result of a collision what exactly collided and if it's not a result of a collision and so how could it possibly form otherwise the other thing about this one that makes this very unusual is that it actually has an extremely high chance of one they face on colliding with other moons I'm going to demonstrate this in a few seconds by basically trying to Colitis another object going in the opposite direction but it might actually take up to a billion years for it to actually have any serious risk because these objects are really small and the distances between them are really really large well that's kind of all we know about this moon for now and if you want to learn more about this or want to follow the actual study itself this is from the Academy University and I believe the principal investigator for this is Scott Shepherd he actually started studying or tried to find Planet 9 back in 2017 and since then this is actually what they've discovered accidental moons well let's finish this video by simulating what a collision would another moon would look like here so we're going to actually pretend as if this is actually another moon going in the opposite direction and literally smacking into the object the other object is going to be approaching Valley to do in a few seconds actually made a spelling mistake here it's valid to do not Valley to do and it's slightly larger it's maybe about 1.4 kilometers or 1.6 kilometers in diameter and they're moving toward each other at a speed of about 3 kilometers per second because that's the orbital speed of these objects at this distance from Jupiter this collision is most likely going to generate quite a lot of debris and it's very likely that this will also result in some sort of a ring specifically a ring around Jupiter at a relatively far away distance so there's a high chance that if this collision ever occurs Jupiter might actually get another ring it already has a bunch but it can always use more so this is slightly slower than normal speed it's about half the normal speed but here comes the collision and because it's head-on it's going to generate a tremendous amount of energy as you can see so these large particles escaping from this collision might actually even end up on planet Earth and that's about it now interesting it is basically almost completely stopped this object now so it actually is good to start following into Jupiter and at some point it might also end up re-entering Jupiter's atmosphere and basically falling onto Jupiter as well now whether this is actually what happened to other such fragments in the system I guess time will tell for now though that's all we know about Valley Tudo and about this unusual discovery of twelve new moons of Jupiter anyway thank you for watching subscribe if you still haven't and click that big symbol that looks like a bell just so that you get notified about new videos come back tomorrow space out and as always bye bye you
hkZRUs8A_9Q,12:05,en,true,true,ok,,back in 2017 these scientists using so-called pan stars which was a fast response telescope used to detect certain objects like comets and asteroids detected this unusual object known today as umuamua and years later we're still trying to figure out what exactly this was how a wonderful person today we might actually finally have a solution a very sound scientific solution that does not involve aliens but before i start i actually wanted to briefly mention why we had this controversy and this unusual debate about the origins of this object and without going into details about the object itself the only reasonable explanation i see to all of this is well unfortunately for the lack of better words scientific ego the idea of wanting to be that one scientist discovering something absolutely extraordinary somewhere out there and being that first person to mention it to provide proof for it and to then basically be in a spotlight because of this now unfortunately in science this happens quite a lot and also unfortunately in science because of this there are two main problems one of the main problems with this is that eventually this causes the public to lose fate and to lose any kind of confidence in scientific discoveries in the scientific community and in scientists in general second of all the problem with this mentality is that this creates a kind of a race to try to be that one person to discover something incredible so that you can be in a spotlight which also often ends up in people making a lot of mistakes in the process and then basically becoming a kind of a pariah or just losing their job completely now that's not exactly what i wanted to focus on but it's really important to understand that when trying to figure out what we're looking at it's super important in science not to jump to conclusions especially when those conclusions can be explained by any other reasonable means and even though we all really want to believe in extraterrestrial intelligence and a lot of us actually are convinced the aliens are somewhere out there trying to explain a phenomenon that can be explained in different ways by basically implying that it's probably alien intelligence is actually a somewhat irresponsible thing to do at least for scientists it is totally okay if you're not a scientist though but if you are in a scientific community it is extremely important to be very prudent in investigating your claims and in trying to avoid turning a hypothesis into an actual fact because that's what's been happening with a lot of new discoveries in the last few decades planet 9 right here being the other culprit but anyway despite all of this i still wanted to really talk about this object because the new paper in some sense is kind of brilliant and in some sense it's actually extremely interesting to read what the scientists had to say but first of all let's actually talk about the shape of umamoa because what i've been showing you so far is this really unusual cigar-like shape but a lot of scientists really do not believe this was the shape at all as a matter of fact a lot of new studies including the study i talked about a few years ago determined that the shape probably looks something similar to what you see right here a kind of a flat pancake like shape or in some sense it also looks like basically a bar of soap after you use it for a very long time which is actually an important analogy because we're going to come back to this in a few minutes but unfortunately because all of the illustrations so far have been made using this shape i'm going to have to use this just to illustrate my point so we know that this object came into the solar system moving at a velocity slightly lower than would be expected from a typical interstellar object what this implies according to the scientists is that this object probably wasn't really traveling for a very long time across the interstellar space the suggestion here being that it's maybe about 500 million years stops possibly even less than that we also believe that it originally entered the outer solar system roughly around the year 1605 so essentially in the beginning of the astronomy and it's probably going to leave officially leave the solar system by the year 2430 moving at a speed of about 26.3 kilometers per second now one of the more unusual features of this object was of course its light curve for some reason this is what the scientists observed which they interpreted as the object tumbling around as it was basically moving through the solar system but the actual shape has been debated ever since at first it was a cigar shape later on scientists actually worked out that it was probably more of a disc shape but so far nothing really makes this object unusual but then something happened that the scientists didn't expect as they started to observe this object leaving the solar system they realized that there was a slight deviation between the observed orbit and the expected orbit now for comics that's actually totally not unusual we expect the comets as they emit a lot of material from their core generally start to change their orbit and trajectory just a little bit and usually this is correlated with the commentary tale itself but what made umamu different is that the commentary tale was not observed at all and so the trajectory here was changing yet at the same time the tail was not observed anywhere and because of this well that's where this explanation came from and honestly at least scientifically this still kind of doesn't make sense because there are so many other better explanations with two papers that you can find in the description below probably being the best explanation we have so far and in the paper there are really only two main assumptions that are being made one of them is that it was definitely a pancake shape and the second explanation well it's actually in this image to some extent it's the color of the object mixed with the idea of what it's actually made out of it was not made from the same material as typical comets we detect such as the famous 2020 neowise comet which usually are made out of different frozen gases all sorts of water ices and also carbon monoxide carbon dioxide methane and pneumonia a lot of these gases are usually visible and also emits certain types of colors as we look at them when the sun illuminates them from the distance but we also know that there are a lot of objects out there in the outer solar system such as for example objects in the same vicinity and in the same orbit as beautiful pluto right here that actually are made out of something different something that gives pluto this beautiful reddish color that's nitrogenized a lot of this red stuff you see on the surface that's basically nitrogen ice and that's something that evaporates very differently from the material that usually is present in most comets and so in other words what the scientists in this paper imply was that it was actually a chunk of nitrogen ice most likely separated from some distant pluto-like object in another star system or in other words it was basically a chunk of exoplanetary pluto or exopluto exodwarf planet whatever you want to call it with a very elegant explanation provided in this illustration right here so all this starts possibly about 400 to 500 million years ago as something collides with a distant pluto-like object in another star system and essentially jacks this really large piece that eventually escapes into the outer star system or essentially into the interstellar space now originally this chunk was probably more circular in shape but with time because of the way that nitrogen interacts with cosmic rays for example it slowly eroded through various types of radiation and in some sense just like your soap in your bathroom eventually becomes kind of flattened now you've all seen this before as you rub the soap around and as you basically use it over the next few weeks it eventually becomes really really flat same mechanism applies to what happened here it then enters the solar system approaches the closest point to the sun in 2017 and then eventually makes its way out of the solar system and just a few months later we were able to see it with the telescope and those deviations from the orbit were very likely caused by the evaporation of nitrogen ice from the surface and it just so happens that well as nitrogen evaporates it doesn't actually produce any kind of tails at all we would not really be seeing this anywhere and on top of this because this was a chunk of ice from another dwarf planet the implication here is that it was probably also a lot more reflective and thus the object was probably much smaller than the we initially assumed and by being so much smaller the amount of emissions coming from the object were able to deviate its orbit a lot more than initially predicted and so by being a reflective chunk of ice and by also emitting a lot of nitrogen in the process a lot of the observations of the orbital changes can be easily explained and are easily explained in this particular paper as a matter of fact this explanation seems to provide the exact match to everything we've seen so far even the reflectivity of this object was very very similar to the reflectivity we usually detect on objects like pluto and triton so in other words it was definitely a chunk of a dwarf planet or some sort of an object from another star system but from the same region where we usually discover dwarf planets and the object itself probably came from a relatively young star system that was still being developed something that just like the solar system in the beginning experienced a lot of different collisions which is why this object was probably released in the first place which of course also confirms that well it seems other star systems also have their own dwarf planets that are probably made of the same stuff as pluto triton and a lot of dwarf planets in the solar system but with recent estimates suggesting that approximately seven such objects should be passing through the solar system every single year we now have a great opportunity to possibly discover another one of these objects and study it in a lot more detail before it disappears once again and despite all of the other assumptions and controversy that this object created it still is one of the most interesting discoveries of the last decade and is definitely one of those discoveries that a lot of scientists will be talking about years to come but probably not because of this definitely because of what's in these two papers that you can find in the description below but unfortunately for now that's kind of all we know although for me personally this explanation is more than enough it provides all of the necessary answers and provides all the explanations to everything that was seen in this unusual object once we discover something else out there specifically once we find another one of these objects i'll make sure to fold this up with another video until then as someone once said keep your mind open but not so open that your brain falls out and well stay wonderful i'll see you tomorrow come back tomorrow to learn something else maybe subscribe maybe share this with someone who loves to learn about space and sciences and maybe support this channel on patreon by joining the channel membership or by buying the wonderful person t-shirt you can find in the description either way i'll see you tomorrow stay wonderful and as always bye [Music] [Music] you
rNmkt5c6yvE,44:09,en,true,true,ok,,[Music] hello wonderful person this is Anton and in today's video we're going to do a Halloween special we're going to start a game called alien isolation this is a horror game that was released uh I think it was last year and actually did try it uh for a little bit got super super scared stop playing never recorded it figured I never would have to but then I kind of got a suggestion from many of you saying hey why don't you play this game it sounds pretty scary you can do it so I figured you know what why not let's do it this was actually a game I was planning to play for a long time even back in the days when I started playing um some of the previous games I played like for example the uh Solace project is what I was looking for the word I totally forgot anyway um this is going to be played entirely in real time and I'm actually thinking of possibly even twitching this at some point uh basically doing a live stream but for now we're just going to play so there's actually I have all the expansions I haven't played any of them yet but I'm going to start the main game first now if you don't know anything about this game good because neither do I I kind of know some things about it but you're essentially a plane as and this is by the way this is in case you you don't know what this is about this is a kind of a side story of the movie Alien so here you're the daughter of Ripley the main character from the movie Alien and I believe your job or your mission is to go and find out what's happening with her actual um ship now because this is a life playthrough I guess you can call it kind of a streaming playthrough or will be one at least at some point we're going to play this on the hardest possible difficulty which is Nightmare because why not right right right yeah sure uh nightmare is the ultimate level of difficulty the greatest test of survival skill warning for experienced survival experts only that is not me I am not at all that person that they mentioned but I'm gonna do it just for your own pleasure and you'll get to watch me squirm and scream at the scream at the screen and basically die in Horror oh Jesus what was that I already got scared I don't know what that was survival steam achievement can still be unlocked and hard on nightmare will yeah why not uh from what I understand uh the main difference in difficulty is that the alien is a lot more clever conservative ammunition as you never know when you might need it oh okay nah we'll figure it out as we go right anyway I'm gonna try to make this a slightly less serious playthrough I might actually try to make a few jokes here and there because I when I get scared I try to be funny that's my that's my defense mechanism 20th Century Fox presents so um let's get a report of the commercial Starship Nostromo third officer reporting [Music] the other members of the crew Kane Lambert Parker Brad Ash and Captain Dallas are dead that's not good that's uh that's Ripley by the way that's that's my cargo and ship destroyed I should reach the frontier in about six weeks with a little luck the network will pick me up uh-huh this is Ripley last survivor of Minnesota signing off well great great start not creepy at all actually super creep I'm already scared yeah that's not a good start I I was gonna actually turn off the lights and I figured I'm gonna keep them on because one it's really scary with the lights off and two is that you actually want to see my face and I figured I'm gonna have it play with him I'm Samuels I work for the company it's about your mother you may have found her Amanda [Music] a commercial vessel the anisadora has recovered what we believe to be the flight recorder unit of the Nostromo where Zeta reticular what did it tell you we don't know the unit was taken to sevastopol station it's proprietorial material so the company wants it to be collected as soon as possible Supply Depot in the region it's a permanent Freeport I know what it is transit's arranged there's a courier ship called the Torrens heading out that way in two days we're going to travel out a week me and another exec and you if you're willing look Ripley when this job came across my desk I read the case history I know why you're working in the region where she went missing still looking among you oh yeah all right I've been clear to offer you a place on the Torrance if you want to come along I kind of get the story I think you do as well tell me some closure for you I have a feeling he's an Android just like in the alien it's probably trying to trick us but yeah so that's I guess the story so this is her daughter trying to find her mom uh in the movies we never actually know if she has a daughter or any family but I guess this game makes it so that she does and oh it looks like we're in um the whatchamacola tank that's where they usually travel that's what they used to travel through like um faster than light travel I guess what are these called back to tanks no that's in Star Wars all right so here we go that's the game right hey move keys to walk yay okay cool cool uh now I'm playing on the highest detail but it still kind of looks a little bit choppy but it's okay anyway um you may be asking yourself what are you wearing Anton what is that what is that thing that you have on your on your shirt what is that vest it's actually it wasn't my costume for Halloween I was uh Frodo Baggins Frodo Baggins the Frodo extraordinaire okay objective of data explore the torrent so I guess we're in a ship called the Torrance this looks this looks incredibly realistic if you ever watched the movie Ellie and this is actually what the ships look like in there get dressed yeah probably a good idea too oh I'm naked okay uh can I can I can I oh I can move books with my feet there's a Gamepad what are you reading nothing interesting all right so let's not waste too much time what's this for sumo wrestler uh it's telling us to explore the torrents I guess things that's probably the name of the ship I'm also surprisingly tall I feel like I'm bumping my head right now uh yeah let's go here first hello anybody personal store is Japanese oh yeah so back in the days uh this was when Japan was like a superpower or basically super super important in terms of cultural advantages uh advances and um basically Japanese culture was all over the place so back then people thought that Japan is going to be the future it's going to be all over the place everything's gonna be Japanese they were wrong Japanese economy crashed Japan became uh Japan as it is today it's just basically a country today we think it's going to be China uh okay what's this verlane you on the lookout for a navigational officer I have a friend that just lost his ship and he's looking for work I can vouch for him okay okay that's a message I don't want to read it it's not for me I don't like snooping around reading other people's emails I hear something hey he's so cute you use registration points to manually save your progress they will warn you if enemies are nearby enemies plural by plural why is it plural I thought it was only one enemy I want to take a shower foreign oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah okay that was enough that's enough bathroom is not working that's okay I don't have to go get dressed all right mission complete I feel like I've completed a day's work let's go back back to bed uh okay so we have verlane that's the person in the email Connor Samuels Taylor Ripley oh everyone's signed in what'd I do what oh oh that just turned on the screen okay how do I save the game you mentioned the game save where is that oh it's right there ah a hello it's a phone that's cool all right okay so uh yeah I wanna I don't know what the current save data is but I'm gonna override it I think maybe that's my old playthrough that I never never finished I kind of just started played around a little bit and figured it was too scary and wait do we read this already go back go back quit quit quit quit quit quit okay moving on moving on with our lives are we going the right way Maybe okay hello Ripley my name is Ripley I am a friend I'm here to find my mama help me find my mother my mother are you my mother are you Mommy Ripley is actually was always one of my most favorite sci-fi characters she's like the Epic manifestation of a super powerful woman um they kind of destroyed her in like Elliott three I think she kind of dies but then she's been recreated in Alien for uh and becomes even more powerful why can I not run is there no running in this game I'm sure there's running what is this what does this button do oh hi oh hello oh who are you Taylor good morning oh you're terribly it's certainly not good I very much doubt it's morning either sorry I feel like death death I don't know how you people put up with hypersleep regularly it's called hyper sleep I remember now I don't do long haul very often most legal execs don't travel further than the coffee machine I'm surprised raylen newtani felt the need to send legal at all the loss of the Nostromo in its cargo cost the company a lot of money it's important we find out what happened if I can close the case with a conclusive accident report it'll look great with my superiors I'm sorry that was insensitive realize your mother has been missing for 15 years that's a really old it's okay Boombox we'll both get what we want right have you seen Samuels no he's probably been up for hours I'll catch up with him I really like how this game is actually uh how it develops the story cool yeah this is super old I used to have this when I was like 10. uh but that's because this is an old sci-fi it's based on an old sci-fi interpretation of the future now Samuels where are you where would you be where would you be Samuels and what is this oh I can pick up things find blueprints to help you craft items from the components you collect that is awesome this game has crafting I did not know that what can I craft uh yeah this is probably a lot right yeah okay so not this way still don't know why I can't run it's not shift for sure uh yeah I guess I'm not a runner you know what I even in real life I don't like Ryan I'm always a walker roughly places is this safe is this safe all right all right is anybody here Samuels please tell me you haven't been eaten already can I go there no no you cannot young sir or lady actually I'm a lady I'm a young lady young independent lady strong independent woman I Don't Need No Man oh hi you're that other guy ah Ripley Samuels did you wake up early well I don't really need oh you're a robot ICS I realize it's a very similar morning it's been a Strummer yes m-class a later pattern but close inspection I've worked engineering jobs on ships like this of course you're so close it's Taylor up again you're so close to me traveler hyper sleep may have been punishing for him we talked she seems nervous I hadn't noticed she's a skilled executive there should help us with any legal issues we might encounter I want to see your shoes all right he's definitely an Android oh okay looks like we're up uh okay we're up wait what was this oh that's a cool effect uh oh hi I'm just gonna follow you this is really cool this is actually feels like a like a living Universe I love how they made this good job whoever made this game anyway I am ready to face the monster I'm not scared yet I'm a little bit scared please don't scare me maybe scare me just a little bit and then I don't want to be scared after that uh yeah okay then another thing is in all these science fiction movies I'm never going to explain how the whole gravity thing works they just call it like oh we have this anti-gravity thing and hope you all had a restful Journey artificial grounds is in very good order for that doesn't work that way he was a wreck when I bought her took a few years and a lot of contracts to refit she pays for herself now hello captain reporting I believe your contact is Marshall weights is that right for Judy all hail Sebastopol and arrange boarding with him good let's get this done oh this is so beautiful Taylor routine in and out Connor how we doing rcmg loaded and calibrated Vector locked another guy there Channel open Captain does everyone have their briefing document watch the approach on the monitors hello the pilot it's awesome uh yeah this was a pretty good looking Planet there look at that it's a gas giant of some sorts very similar to our Jupiter and that's actually the plan we get to see in the beginning of the game when you look at the opening screen with some sort of uh not so bright star slightly less bright than our own Sun possibly some sort of a red dwarf or orange dwarf that is all right so what am I doing collecting documents uh documents documents documents The Briefing file there we go mission complete easy peas and lemon squeeze oh cool sound is this switch to monitors I cannot hear anything in space Sebastopol station is that damage looks like that punch-up 74 tight angle looks like the dry dock Bay is screwed I can't bring the torns into that this is a commercial vessel torns out of Sinclair registration number msv 7760 calling Sebastopol traffic control we're carrying three passengers in a weyland's yutani bond you're holding the Nostromo flight recorder unit we request immediate permission to transfer the passenger's port side over [Music] hello Marshall this is the torrent say again okay I would really appreciate if it didn't go in stations calm seem pretty screwed up too late Samuel's suit with a radio booster I can only keep the torrents in transit for 24 hours you'll have heard from us man I don't think so you guys are all dead oh wait that's me I'm Not Dead [Music] oh no she's afraid foreign [Music] that's pretty awesome wow this is a really impressive they definitely copied the design of the original alien really well my God Ripley you're doing good too [Music] hold on [Music] yeah okay Taylor respond to anybody I guess they're gone [Music] oh now you have no sound really game you need to be consistent either sound or no sound [Music] alright so that's I guess how the game really really starts uh we find ourselves trapped on uh the station sevastopol which is actually the name of one of the cities in Russia I believe uh where there was a very big battle in the in the Second World War from what I remember it's actually in the south of the uh uh Southwest of the country and the stroma recorder is here this is why we're here and the recorder is supposed to have information about our mother okay then let's begin can I move oh yeah I can a what do I need to do go in here oh boy find health um thank you yeah that's pretty obvious I need to find help so how do I do that where where do I do that hello is anybody here oh here huh boom oh that was easy that's all I have to do all right now what now I go here I don't want to go there thank you is there another exit for me no it's are you serious can I not go in there it's very dark no okay flashlight and there's nothing there's no flashlight ah okay then hello use registration for Instagram where is it here it is hello hello don't don't kill me no kilo I come in peace [Music] are you sure you want to overwrite yeah okay all right feeling safe already what's this nothing okay those sounds are not helping they're really not helping can we not make those sounds please yeah the quickie squeaky ones yeah no no thank you I don't like it all right yeah I'm going back no no no no no no no no no no how about no how about a big n o like with a capital and capital O what what I didn't see anything Sebastopol stability compromised really to the nearest Marshall checkpoint and stand by while orbital stabilizers realize what does that mean oh orbital stimulators wait is our orbit declining are we gonna fall maybe I shouldn't be here how about we go back to the ship huh that doesn't look very safe cone help me cone what do I do oh here huh claim oh boy that's not a safe this place I could find but I guess we'll have to deal with this oh okie dokie oh Kentucky yeah right then this is not going well for us so far I'm scared of nothing but I'm already scared I'm terrified of the noises how about we don't make those noises game I only have two pairs of underwear to change if I pee myself once I only have one one life left uh okay I need to go there I guess but wait a second what is this link the I guess it's the local computer network how do I how do I go back scroll down no up and down highlight no cue back oh here we go uh so boys and girls you've probably heard the whispers about by now and I can confirm it's officials so stopwatch being the commissions okay I'm not gonna read the rest I think it makes sense basically they were trying to decommission the station and everyone's going to be losing their jobs but something went wrong I'm just guessing but I think it's gonna make sense right oh I just got worse there's so much work okay you're tough Ripley I'll give you that you're one tough lady I would be probably on the ground crying right now too Fair how what oh oh hold Q to open inventory select flare R2 activate uh I guess it helps a little bit but not a lot are oh okay where am I throwing it I don't want to throw it I want to keep it can I just not throw it oh I think he wants me to throw it okay let's throw it then I threw it can I pick it up oh come on I wanna I want it back anyway moving on oh I can run now yay I think I have to go in there uh so this is some sort of a cargo area possibly a rival area for new um finders I guess it's a mining station right yeah thanks thank you very much yeah very very nice flamethrow fuel what do the flip Rover I got a sensor too I don't know what that's for wait why am I here there's nothing here how do I go there and where do I go oh here [Music] what all right what is that sound oh it says something uh moving yeah something's definitely moving there how about it stops moving and not move doesn't move anymore what does it say you always what you always know working Joe someone new what okay so far this doesn't really make sense but I guess we'll figure it out as we go let's go to whatever this is I'm sure nothing bad will happen to us right right we're gonna be safe right we're gonna meet friends we're gonna find our recorder unit and everything's gonna be just fine just fine turn this off I don't need no music right now I'm not in the mood for the country music okay more dark oh that's the that's the station right I don't think so I think nobody's here this is oh hi what's doing that please don't do that restore power okay I will try to do that at least he asked me to do this is a cool looking station restore power okay this is I guess that's my main goal right now restoring power which means this life for rent huh oh terminals will update my maps where this ah cool how do I map it how do I use a map where's the map map data unavailable okay well that didn't do much what's here nothing all righty emergency what's this generator oh I have to turn this on first okay oh cool I see I see uh-huh let's save our game wait I heard something move above me I was I literally just turned around and this happened it's kind of scared me I totally just heard something move about me I totally just heard something hello monster is there a monster here uh if you're looking for our stash I've moved it the code is zero three four zero okay I'll remember that zero three four zero actually I probably forget that I may need to write this down uh okay so there's some the commission of Sebastopol audio Harris Turner get back here now we have a track somewhere in engineering lock the terminal down kill the power and don't forget your reports [Music] they were running from something okay so these guys turn off the power I just turned it back on possibly not the smartest move I made today [Music] I heard that but also maybe not the dumbass so am I going here am I going down there let's go check out where they ran to oh that's how it's going to be then okay you're gonna throw things at me of scary nature oh is it stash I want it ah flame throw of fuel because I want my flamethrower what is this did I come from here yeah it came from here okay so I guess there's nothing else here except for stash stuff this was empty uh okay okay so I guess I do have to go to that area this is basically I guess the reception security checkpoint that it says right there okay hello this looks like I'm Gonna Get Zapped so I'm gonna Crouch under it I'm smart I play video games I'm smart I know these things hey Caden what's going on here tomorrow no together future very good English oh what beautiful look at that what the hell happened here this is beautiful look at those Stars yeah what happened here looks like there was a riot a lot of Chinese everywhere hey no entry like what do I need I have a torch okay I'll try to fight that I will try to find that Torchy you asked me to find so then let's maybe go oh what's this nothing what's this nothing what's nothing nothing okay well that's fine that's fine I only hear my footsteps but I think I'm making too much noise maybe I shouldn't do that oh can I look at it oh that's so cool that's so cool hello help me right here I'm right here you're lying oh damn it okay interesting whoa what's that noise whoa I'm gonna go hide someone that was really scary it's not over yet I think it's over so we sold our own ship and then they didn't see us clearly and now there's that noise and I really don't like it but now it's really quiet and I also don't like that either I heard that I heard that hello hello oh it's a hockey game maybe I have to press this I should really stop pressing the random buttons but not this time this time I'm gonna press the random button [Music] generator I kind of like how how everything here is like very retro sci-fi exactly like you would expect in the alien universe okay so that something just opened up what's this some sort of a TV station I thought it was a person it's not a person uh yeah this is terrifying I've got to be honest with you this is super terrifying this is so well made this is so scary like there's literally I don't know what's gonna happen I know nothing about this situation I'm guessing the Elegance is going to show up at some point Zoe I'm sorry but I won't need you to come in next week so they're basically firing everyone oh wait I didn't read the second message what's the second message there second message said she was Face Fight employees uh to prevent Panic it's clear to potential passenger there are currently no scheduled flights to live in sevastopol okay wait wait what is Apollo Apollo is essentially a the one um that monitors and provides guidance for all uh working Joe's of celestoppel okay so there's a central AI here oh there's a save game too save my game please thank you very much save it override it and there we go okey-dokey what's this oh I didn't even see that I guess I'm going here [Music] uh uh uh I don't want to be here right now I really don't want to be here right now it's right about me [Music] I don't want to do this hello [Music] oh hi who are you stay pretty I stay perky huh I'll stay perky I'm the prettiest person you know those kitchen place is falling apart yeah it sure does um okay okay okay okay can I pick this up yeah it says use what use what I saw that I saw the use here we go oh uh I guess I'm going inside next well [Music] alrighty then someone's definitely above me someone is definitely climbing right above me I don't know who it is but he's definitely following me around maybe it's my secret then someone who really wants to be friends with me what was that I don't know I saw something did I see anything I don't know I saw the shadow okay that sounded like a person running away ah what's that no what am I stepping in someone new I knew nothing that looks so terrifying but I'm gonna go there anyway I have no choice there's only one way I have no choice but to go one way here and press the buttons on this computer no I don't have to press them Vista oh boy this is not cool this is not cool game you're creating these environments for me to have a heart attack and and then you create more environments like this without even more terrifying and then oh boy oh boy oh button wait that's a generator what's what's here what is this what is that okay let's go press generator button that should will do some good to us right [Music] close your eyes kids here comes the monster [Music] no huh I'll be damned nobody came they're just here scream I hope nobody got hurt I hope oh hey I want to go in there how do I go in there what that maintenance Jack requires what that sound what's that sound I don't like any of these sounds can I just not stay here any longer I don't like this place I don't like this at all okay so all this is locked nothing here I guess I'm guessing I just have to go through that door that opened up which is right here wait but there's nothing here just doesn't have anything what am I doing that is kind of confusing did anything else open up outside maybe are those bodies I didn't even see that holy crap [Music] oh I see how this is you're breaking the lamps in my face now I'm just getting the last security brace you swearing don't swear this is a friendly Channel family friendly Channel we don't swear we play nice and we scream and run away when it gets scary so I need to find a Jack to open that door what's that Jack going to look like maybe it's in here maybe it is this maybe it is that maybe it is not maybe it is this maybe it is that Maybe blood great oh is this like a torture chamber chamber Maybe I need to open this too okay give me that maintenance thing come on come on game where is it at oh that body ah oh both possible gamepad or I guess a joystick is a more more appropriate term for this so I need to go through here right because why would I not go through a hole with a dead body yeah wait where am I going am I still going to the same place or I saw in there I guess so oh this is gonna be creepy isn't it it's gonna be super old blood everywhere of course oh okay then hello you are okay to the highest Authority okay my name is Zachary Watson that's Watson you hear that their job station with us and no one knows what it is no one [Â __Â ] knows lockdown you know I have to keep something else okay well so far nothing scary has happened I've been basically scared of myself with different noises here but we've at least uh discovered some things we've discovered a little bit about the ship we've discovered a little bit about the story and this is going to be a pretty interesting playthrough and I think we're going to continue this in the next part because this part is getting a little bit too long anyway guys thank you so much for watching thank you for subscribing thank you for sharing this video with your friends and thank you for being a loyal subscriber I appreciate all your support the interview subject I'll see you guys next video bye I just want to know about your boss he's got you all into a lot

aDqQj8MKXxA,13:26,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person this is anton and it's about time we've talked about some of the major updates from the mission on mars specifically the helicopter mission known as ingenuity and there have been some major updates specifically in regards to the difficulty that the mission is facing right now and there's really one major difficulty it's becoming more and more challenging for the helicopter to fly on mars and so let's talk about some of these updates and some of these new discoveries and talk about the future of this mission as well but let's obviously start with a question of what's so difficult about the flight and what's really happening with the helicopter well obviously because of this mission we've learned quite a lot about the martian atmosphere and we also learned a lot about the ability of helicopters to fly on mars as a matter of fact the future missions that are probably going to be responsible for recovering some of the samples from mars already being changed to potentially being helicopters as well for example it's really impressive that the scientists by just knowing what the atmosphere of mars contained from some of the previous missions were able to work out the exact size and the exact speed with which the helicopter blades had to spin in order for the helicopter to be able to fly and to be able to function for so many months but when the mission was being created nobody actually expected for the helicopter to last so long and for the mission continue past the initial 5 flights and because nasa has now expanded the mission the scientists behind ingenuity are facing a lot of new challenges one challenge here being mars itself and specifically the martian atmosphere and the martian climatic changes because just like earth mars also has seasons and with every single season the conditions on the martian surface change quite dramatically for example in this recent study that you can find in the description below the scientists investigated and actually helped us visualize how the conditions on the martian south pole change with these seasonal variations specifically how the south pole develops the ice caps now this is really interesting because it doesn't just develop the ice caps it also changes the density of air and thus changes the overall pressure as well so right here there's not enough ice and a lot of co2 circulates around the martian atmosphere increasing the overall pressure but then when the ice starts to freeze the density and the pressure decrease creating different conditions for several months and these seasonal changes are now affecting the ingenuity probe as well when the scientists were planning this mission a few years ago they designed ingenuity to withstand pressures that are approximately 1.2 to about 1.5 of the atmospheric pressure on our planet equivalent to about 0.0 145 kilograms per cubic meter of atmospheric density but it's been over six months now and the atmospheric pressure has dropped quite a lot simply due to these seasonal variations and basically because mars is now sort of in the late summer early fall stage so if we were to compare it to planet earth it's basically becoming a little bit cooler by the way the website from the planetary society compiled the entire table explaining each season on mars and showing us when it starts and when it ends as you probably know already martian year is almost double the length of the earth year so the seasons here are slightly different and so because of this the martian atmosphere is now dropping even more specifically at this moment it's approximately at one percent of the earth atmosphere which is below the design limitation of 1.2 percent and even though the difference is only 0.2 percent it's actually enough for the helicopter to start experiencing problems when flying and so generally for any helicopter or any sort of a drone that uses very similar technology for flight there's a really important concept known as the thrust margin thrust margin refers to a kind of excess thrust that allows the helicopter to perform different maneuvers such as pitch down or pitch up and increase its speed in this case the thrust margin for ingenuity is approximately thirty percent and so this additional thrust is required for the helicopter to perform nominally but the thinnest in these lower pressures the thrust margin drops down to about eight percent which technically is no longer enough to perform certain maneuvers in this case it's sort of similar to a normal helicopter flying really high in the air where the thrust margin is so low that the helicopter starts stalling and sort of starts dropping from the skies in other words it becomes really difficult to operate a helicopter when the density is really low but there's obviously a solution to this you could hypothetically spin the blades even faster and by spinning the blades faster you would produce more lift and thus produce more thrust margin as well and so that's what the team behind ingenuity decided to do they decided to investigate if this could potentially be a solution making the blade spin approximately 10 faster at the rpm of about 2800 the previous rpm was only about 2500 and so that's exactly what the scientists have been trying to do for the past month they wanted to test if this actually works so following a somewhat uneventful 13th flight before the 14th flight the team decided to test the really high speed rotation of the blades just to see if it would create any potential problems for the helicopter itself and one of the potential problems they sort of expected is what we sometimes refer to as resonance now when it comes to resonance in engineering i think the most famous example is the tacoma bridge that collapsed back in 1940 this is essentially the example of what resonance can do if a structure is built incorrectly you might already know the story but essentially what's happening here is that the natural vibrations of the bridge have the exactly same frequency as the vibrations produced by the wind in this particular region and because of this the wind ends up magnifying the vibrations of the bridge itself which then sort of oscillates even more and eventually collapses because it just can no longer sustain itself and so in theory something extremely similar could happen to the helicopter if the blades spin at the resonance that's similar to the other vibrations produced by the helicopter as it flies through the air because it was never tested at these particular rpms it's unfortunately unknown to the scientist if the resonance is going to be produced until they actually test it and until they make it fly in the martian atmosphere the other obvious problem is the fact that it's going to need more energy because of the 10 higher rpm the system will have to withstand much higher loads and this could potentially wear out some of the parts much faster and then there's also the problem of the speed of sound itself at 2 800 rpm the blades are going to be spinning at about 80 percent the speed of sound on mars and because of this they're going to start experiencing a lot of aerodynamic drag which in turn will actually make the flight itself extremely difficult and so these really high rotation speeds it becomes almost impossible to make this flight efficient nevertheless before the 14th flight the scientists decided to test this on the ground and the test was completely successful the blades were spinning just fine and it seemed to have been working and so the scientists were planning to perform the 14th flight back in mid-september but it didn't work there was an anomaly something was not allowing the helicopter to take off the ground and so the system shut down completely and following the initial investigation and looking through the logs from the helicopter the culprit behind the recent anomaly turned out to be the flight servos the system detected a problem in the service and shut down the entire procedure canceling the flight so it was actually an automatic shutdown and the team actually posted this picture showing us exactly which part was responsible for this but first what exactly is a servo well if you've ever done robotics you've probably seen something like this these devices are normally responsible for somehow sensing and correcting errors and usually are able to do so automatically although generally they do come in different shapes and sizes and generally control different functions of either mechanical or electrical activity but in case of ingenuity this little device right here is the servo that created the anomaly that basically shut down the entire system with the data from the helicopter suggesting that the servo was oscillating or basically moving around by approximately one degree which was completely unexpected by the system and so the entire flight was shut down and on top of this at this particular moment mars is actually right behind the sun and because of this it's sort of impossible for the mission to communicate with the probe and to receive any more details or to try to conduct other tests they'll have to wait until mid-october before they can resume these tests nevertheless they do have some theories on what's probably happening here the first theory is that well maybe the things have just become too old these servers are just no longer attached as solid as they used to be attached and so they're wiggling a lot more and basically because the mission has already sort of been extended way more than originally planned and for those of you who have used drones before you know that sometimes the actual blades stop working for one reason or another and so this is definitely something that could potentially happen here as well the other explanation is actually maybe because of the high speed spin test maybe because of this speed involved here instead of the resonance on the entire helicopter it seemed to have created some kind of a unique oscillation in the servos themselves and so one way of possibly testing this is obviously by speeding the blaze floor and so if the oscillations disappear at slower rotations of the blades well this just means that it's going to be impossible for the helicopter to fly in the future at least using the high speed of rotation and because the atmospheric pressure on mars is not going to be getting denser for the next year or so it means that the mission is probably going to be finished and so at least for now during the martian conjunction when mars is behind the sun the only thing that's going to be happening is the general communication between perseverance and ingenuity as they sort of send the signals to each other in order to make sure that they both stay alive but in mid-october we'll finally get signals back from perseverance and we'll finally be able to see if the mission is still a go or if ingenuity is going to have to retire simply because it's unable to fly anymore which i guess would be kind of ironic because it had its 13th flight unlucky 13 i guess which i guess would be kind of sad but the mission has been a dramatic success with ingenuity outperforming any initial expectations with this failure also teaching us a little bit more about why things don't always work on mars or how things can go wrong for some of the future missions and in one of the previous videos that you can find somewhere right there i've actually mentioned this mission right here that's probably going to be launching to mars in the next few years assuming of course everything works out as planned and so for now i guess that's all we know the mission had an anomaly the anomaly is most likely caused by either the parts getting a little bit too old or possibly because the blades were spinning too fast but we're not going to know if the mission is finally finished or if it's going to be continuing until sometime in late october well until then check out all the relevant details and links including the blog posts from the scientists behind this mission in the description below and in the next few weeks we'll definitely be talking more about the mission and about the resolutions or solutions to some of these problems until then thank you for watching subscribe if you haven't share this with someone who has learned about space and sciences and maybe come back tomorrow to learn something else maybe

kFi800H9xV0,12:53,en,true,true,ok,,hello wonderful person mrs. Anton and this run here is Neptune today we're going to be trying to use a little bit of science and math to try to discover how many napkins can we actually fit into the same orbit and how many adaptions would actually survive in a stable orbit for several billion years anyway welcome to what the math now this idea is actually based on something we've done previously where we kind of placed several Earth's and several other planets in the same orbit and we used what's known as a hill sphere to try to identify how many planets we can actually fit without destabilize in the system now for Neptune it's actually a little bit different because well first of all Neptune is very very massive it's a lot more massive than Earth is and in this particular case it's massive enough to even influence our friend Saturn but what is interesting about Neptune is that it actually has the highest heels fear radius of all planets and all objects in our solar system here if you go to Wikipedia and you look up hero's fear you discover that there are several objects that have relatively high heels fear and this is the hill sphere radius in in telemeters and for Earth which is right here it is way way way smaller than it is for the gas giants but specifically for an option because it's actually the farthest away from the Sun so it's sphere radius is close to about 100 million kilometers now we're actually going to try to calculate this more specifically and more precisely using the unone calculator we use in one of the previous videos and let's do this right now let's actually discover how much or how far the Neptune's hill sphere is in terms of strong clearness now remember yo sphere itself is just this sphere around the planet where it can have moons essentially anything outside of feel sphere will orbit around the star everything inside will orbit around Neptune now how how far is it how much is hundred million kilometers so in this particular on one calculator from orbit simulator come we're going to put Neptune on top Sun on the bottom this is the third power root and the semi-major axis for Neptune let's actually just confirm it okay it's about thirty point zero six nine nine astronomical units this is the distance from the Sun to an option now I'm going to go here put it right here and what we get is point seven seven five seven strong learners approximately 116 million kilometers we're going to work in AU units because it's a little bit easier remember wanna stroke oh here it is a distance from Earth to the Sun so it's about 78% of the distance of Earth to the Sun this is a pretty insane distance when you think about it so if I were to basically go into a solar system simulation here and zoom in to our friend Neptune that's right there basically it can have moons at a distance of 78% of a distance from Earth to the Sun that's that's pretty far away so you can potentially place an object here at almost one astronomical unit and you can see an earth is still kind of in orbit around it it will it'll be quite a long distance away before we started getting before Earth basically separates from the action and starts orbiting around something else so this is this is pretty cool that means that its large hill sphere will only allow several napkins to be in order but not a lot you wouldn't expect this to be too many but also don't forget it's far away from the Sun so it's orbital distance the actual distance it travels around the Sun is also pretty far now this is a relatively simple to calculate it's basically if we assume that this is almost a circle it's just two pi multiplied by semi-major axis and here this would be approximately 189 s from Akal units so in other words this whole distance is about 189 s from oakland a's so now we can actually start doing a little bit of math and try to figure out how many napkins can we fit in here for it to stay as stable and to basically not destroy our solar system now an option is a pretty massive planet it's about 17 masses of Earth so this by itself gives it quite a lot of influence and also because of an option a lot of the trans-neptunian objects that are orbiting after or past Neptune are usually influenced by it as well but please seen a lot of napkins in this orbit will create a lot of havoc for these tiny objects but the inner objects like Uranus and Saturn will not be affected almost a roll so let's see how many we can we can actually do here by first taking a look at hill sphere which is 0.7 7 5 7 and what we need to do here is refer back to the study by Andrew Smith and Jack lease our Lisa where Lisa where I'm totally mispronouncing your name anyway this study that actually mentioned that to have a stable orbit with many planets in the same orbit the distance between them should be at least eight yo spheres in other words we're taking this number multiplying it by 8 and gaining about six point two is four clearance now if there is a distance of six points to us from clearance between the these Neptune's the orbital parameters will be stable enough for at least a billion years if I divide this number by six point two I'm going to get how many napkins I can place in there and the answer is approximately thirty not really thirty one because it's an odd number and also because it's closer to thirty so in other words you could hypothetically place thirteen options around the Neptune orbit and have a relatively stable system now this would be a lot a lot of Earth's as a matter of fact if you were to look at the mass of Neptune and multiply this by thirty you'll get approximately 513 masses of Earth now that's actually just as much as Jupiter and Saturn combined in other words there is actually a way for us to imagine a star system that might actually have something like this there might be a star system where Jupiter and Saturn never really materialized and instead created a relatively thick ring a very massive ring around the our star system now it is hypothetical we obviously haven't detected this yet but it is quite possible and it would be very very stable so let's do this right now let's see if we can try to generate this I do need to change a few things here know first of all I'm going to well I might as always race this in action a little really need we're gonna create new napkins and we're going to zoom into our Sun and stop the simulation change the mass of the Sun to 513 masses of Earth click on add we're going to add a ring here and this ring is going to contain exactly 30 objects the total mass is going to be divided by the total number of objects and all we have to do now is change the orbital parameters to be let's just do 30 we're gonna go for run number here 30 astronomical units and it has to be an order to ring okay let's see if this works they replace them yep there they are they're called moons and before we continue we just have to reverse our Sun back to one mass of the Sun and last we I may as well give everything a perfect orbit so we need to click on auto orbit here alright so let's see what happens so here are our Neptune's day it should be about 17.1 masses of Earth yep they are they totally look like moons though but this is a pretty massive ring of objects here now I want to see what happens I'm really curious now so we have these transition period objects there and we also have objects like Uranus and Saturn now I did predict that they are not going to be affected but I might have been completely wrong and I'm going to actually decelerate it's just a little bit and let's run this a little bit slower first and accelerate this as we go now I'm actually super curious as to what's going to start happening now first of all I hope that these objects move at the right speed they should be orbiting in a perfect circle and a perfectly circular that is orbit around the Sun and it looks like they are now secondly you can you can see that the distance between them is actually really far compared to our previous simulations this is almost the distance of Sun to earth so they're actually really far away from each other and the only way they can stay stable and it seems like it's actually more or less stable I'm trying to zoom in onto the Sun here the Sun is not really affected by these objects either even though its velocity is changing a little bit it feels like it is more or less stable now some of them seem to be kind of sticking out a little bit but that's also probably because I didn't really place them in a perfectly same plane of orbit you can see that some of them are a little bit higher than the other words but oh no this is actually a pretty stable system now let's see what happens to objects like Pluto because technically Pluto is actually affected by Neptune and its orbit may change I'm going to run this for a few years just to see if Pluto's orbit actually is affected but I think one of the easiest way of seeing this is by clicking on orbits and if you see suddenly things changing dramatically that's because these massive napture are influencing things now right now some orbits are changing a little bit but not to the point where things are flying away completely out of our solar system as a matter of fact it looks like this Neptune ring that we've created is actually stabilizing the system which is very unusual and very very interesting so this is pretty cool so to answer the initial question of how many adapters can you place and not destroy the system is well 30 you could place 30 and to answer the second question of whether things are going to start flying away and disappear and get affected by these Neptune's it looks like no Uranus is still there Saturn and Jupiter are totally in their own thing and all of the transmuter objects seem to be quite unaffected by this as well now it might take billions of years for things to change here a little bit but on the short term sort of thousands of years scale nothing seems to be happening and chances are that because of this ring of napkin around a ring of Neptune's that is around our solar system our planet Earth is now going to be completely protected from invasion by any comets chances are these nature's are just going to basically create this cavity fetal protection ring now well that's really all I wanted to do in this video and hopefully you'll learn something from it and now you know a little bit more about our solar system orbits and how things work both with Hills fears and placing planets in the same orbit in the next video we'll talk about something different and you might learn something else thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you still haven't and sure to say was someone who enjoys watching space videos and once again guys thank you so much for your support both on patreon and on the channel I love you so much thank you see you later space out bye bye and before we finish I need to go ahead and maybe just maybe destroy planet Earth by exploring our Sun my favorite thing to do I don't know why maybe I have a problem and look at that everything just kind of flies apart I'm not as cool as I thought it would be but my napkins actually have created their own a little miniature systems now it's pretty cool
HPmULOnXBqk,10:22,en,true,true,ok,,hey look something else is spinning around me once again hello wonderful person this is anton and today we're going to be talking about some new mysteries discovered in regards to phenomena that are already mysterious to begin with phenomena involving black holes and more specifically we're actually going to be discussing a relatively recent concept that the scientists were able to discover only three decades ago the concept known as the tde or tidal disruption event in a natural representing something like this when a star or some kind of a star-like object passes relatively close to a relatively massive black hole with the star falling apart very likely creating some kind of accretion disk around the black hole and then very likely producing a lot of high energy emissions which can then be seen from really really really far away and have actually been detected several times now using a lot of modern telescopes the phenomenon that involves the concept of spaghettification where the object is literally spaghettified or turned into a very long spaghetti and then soro falls into the black hole although the majority of the material ends up producing the accretion disk and although theoretically the scientists believed that they kind of understood how all this happens very recently another major mystery was uncovered and have been reported in three separate studies with some of the scientists referring to this as radio bursts from zombie black holes and so let's talk a little bit more about this because it is once again somewhat intriguing and somewhat interesting but first a little bit of history the initial idea behind tds was proposed by two scientists working in the paris observatory the iconic jean-pierre lumine the french astrophysicist who was actually the first to create a simulated picture of a black hole back in his 70s and his colleague australian brandon carter who always back in the 80s proposed the idea of these title disruption events which would involve a massive black hole some kind of a star and a lot of spaghettification effects which they believed would produce very specific types of emissions and within about 10 years they were proven correct when some of the first black hole interactions started to be discovered this was found back in the early 90s using the rosette satellite one of the first x-ray satellites that was able to produce and detect quite a lot of interesting data but since then several dozen different tds have been already discovered and confirmed and most of them seem to exhibit properties originally predicted by these two astrophysicists but naturally all of these detections were not without mysteries for example some tds were only partial meaning that at the end there would still actually be some kind of a star-like object left behind some of the recent studies simulating this discover that it basically all has to do with the mass of the star stars that are similar to our own sun or are even less massive are generally going to survive the tdd even though they are going to lose a large chunk of their mass while more massive stars will most likely get completely destroyed creating a much larger accretion disk and the majority of the star material in this case is going to be creating the accretion disk and all of these very powerful emissions with only a very small part of the star's mass making it inside the black hole although interestingly even among some of these recent discoveries and usually some of these sources were actually quite visible in the ultraviolet or even visible light something the scientists did not really anticipate with some of these black holes being able to produce more light than a typical supernova for several months at a time but afterwards returning to their quiet state and becoming more or less invisible once again and so even though there were some mysteries in regards to the emissions detected most of them could be explained one way or another but that's of course until now in these three separate papers the scientists discovered something nobody can explain or anyone expected at all for some reason someone's black holes re-awakened and became active once again months or even years after the initial disruption event and at the moment nobody is certain what's exactly triggering these unusual delayed outbursts with this one here being the first discovered back in february of 2021 this was a radio burst that became active six months after the initial tde and though obviously it could have been explained by maybe something else falling into the black hole not so long after this detection the scientists discovered more in this case this was a very unusual rapid increase in radioactivity two years after the initial disruption by a relatively distant black hole and then another one was found in a completely different galaxy but in this case emitting radio frequencies but also x-rays and so because these black holes seem to come back to life for unknown reasons the scientists refer to them as zombie black holes but i guess more importantly at the moment there is no explanation for why this happens and because this doesn't happen in every case obviously presents a mystery nobody knows how to answer yet but more importantly because of these new detections the scientists now think it might provide us with a lot of answers about the mysteries of black holes and more specifically the mysteries of the formation of their jets since these galactic jets have so much power over the evolution of different galaxies their origin and their influence on the galaxies is currently one of the more important mysteries the scientists are trying to solve but at the moment there are only some theories explaining their origin most of them involve the magnetic fields and the magnetic lines formed around black holes might be very powerful accretion disks and in this case any radio wave emissions coming from these black holes can definitely help the scientists answer soundness questions these radio waves are believed to be created when the plasma expelled from these jets crashes into some of the gas surrounding the massive black hole in the center which in this case is believed to happen right after the star falls apart and creates the accretion disk which then slowly starts to form the jets around the center and so by detecting these delay radio waves the scientists might be able to resolve the mysteries of the formation of these jets but when it comes to the actual formation of these radio waves the scientists have at least one possible explanation coming from smaller black holes here we're talking about the systems often referred to as the x-ray binaries the system with a black hole and some kind of a star where the black hole absorbs the mass from the star and creates various x-rays and so in this case some of this gas that's spaghettified and forms the accretion disk could actually stay around much longer for months or even years at a time but with time this disk that's initially relatively thick grows much colder and much thinner and becomes a lot more unstable and eventually because of the interaction with the magnetic field or the magnetic lines from the black hole this disc can break apart and suddenly release some of the material into the outskirts of the black hole in some sense kind of similar to how our sun often has these magnetic reconnections which sometimes produce solar storms and this material as it travels away from the black hole ends up crashing into the gas nearby which then results in the production of very powerful radio waves and potentially some other emissions and so in other words all this might have to do with the instabilities in this accretion disk but also with very specific interaction between the magnetic lines and the density of the gas itself although the scientists still do not have the definitive answers for why this happens but they do believe they've already discovered several other candidates that have not been published anywhere as a matter of fact this seems to be a relatively common phenomenon that nobody noticed before but like i mentioned it's a phenomenon that could help the scientists solve a lot of mysteries about black holes and about how they form various features in their vicinity and more importantly what happens in the accretion disk and the jets when various objects fall into the black holes and become spaghettified with several new telescope observations starting sometime this year and in 2023 and potentially discovering a lot more of these unusual phenomena but i guess until then well for now it's just going to remain a mystery with some preliminary explanations once we discover more though i'll make sure to follow this up with another video until then thank you for watching subscribe maybe share this with someone who learned about

nLV3_QMfNQs,14:36,en,true,true,ok,,well let's start the video right here on google earth i wanted to show you this very interesting guided tour that you can find here by typing cern a guided tour that essentially takes you to the largest particle collider on the planet the cern collider and here you can kind of explore what all this looks like from the perspective of an engineer or scientist working here or you can kind of zoom in exploring the city itself admiring the entire infrastructure that was created in order to make this particular project operational hello info person this is anton and today we're going to be answering a question that i often get asked on the channel and didn't really get to answer before the question being why is it that we haven't really been able to create any black holes here on planet earth could a particle collider produce a black hole and would such a black hole be dangerous in any way to our planet something that appeared as a major concern for the last couple of decades ever since cern became operational with this article by nasa being particularly intriguing because of the title the day the world didn't end and all this was because of several articles written in various magazines back in the days that suggested that maybe in theory these particle colliders could actually produce some kind of a black hole that could maybe absorb everything on the planet and destroy planet earth but could any of this happen could these black holes be produced in the collider and could they actually destroy anything well if you're about to click away from this video the answer to all these questions is no but let me explain to you in more detail so one of these concerns was actually because of how powerful cern has become it's currently able to collide different types of subatomic particles at ridiculously high velocities with extremely high energies and in the last few years as the scientists installed more and more upgrades on this particle accelerator they were able to beat previous records achieving higher and higher energies which in essence allows them to create a lot of other subatomic particles or exotic particles that could have been predicted by some studies or could have never been thought of before and that's of course how the confirmation of the higgs boson came to be as well the existence of a subatomic particle that was very hypothetical until it was discovered approximately a decade ago but every few years the higher and higher energies are achieved and new records are established which at least in theory could allow the scientists doing all this discover new unusual subatomic particles new phenomena or potentially even new physics something we've discussed in one of the previous videos from a few months ago that should be in the description but early on specifically in the first few years there was a bit of a concern in regards to what could be created by these collisions could the scientists accidentally create something we don't really want to create on planet earth for example could you somehow merge particles in order to create something extremely dense something resembling a black hole a black hole that starts small but eventually absorbs the entire planet and everything around it as well and that's why science communication as a field and as a profession is super important because very often people misunderstand certain concepts and very often associate certain words or certain principles with something that is not actually true in this case black holes many people today imagine a black hole as a kind of a vacuum cleaner with unlimited power something that is super super powerful and something that essentially sucks up all the matter around it and something that even though it could start small would eventually absorb everything around it and expand creating something even larger than before but that's not actually what we believe black holes to be and we don't actually think they do that at all for example in theory you could turn anything into a black hole you could take an apple or you can actually take yourself and condense yourself into very very dense mass that would then become a black hole but in order for an apple or in this case you to become a black hole it would actually have to be ridiculously small even smaller than any subatomic particle for example you can use this calculator that you can find in a description to try to calculate how big of a black hole you would become based on your mass in this case an average adult would actually be a black hole of 10 to the power of minus 17 nanometers and that's super super super small once again that's more than most subatomic particles on top of this we know that black holes generally evaporate and that's based on the hawking radiation principle something that was proposed by iconic stephen hawking a few decades ago and according to this calculator the lifetime of this black hole would be 1 times 10 to the power of minus 11 seconds a tiny tiny fraction of a second before this black hole completely disappears becoming just energy and a black hole that's so small and the black hole that only exists for such a short period of time would not have time to do anything to anything around it it would not be able to absorb any matter it would not be able to do anything to any of the atoms or particles around it and it would just disappear and nobody would know it even existed but that's a black hole that's mass of a person in this case the amount of material used in these studies is minuscule and so the size of this black hole decreases dramatically and so does the total lifetime of this black hole if ever such a black hole was created it would actually exist for less than the universe allows the minimum time frame we have is called planck time in this case it seems to be below that limit in other words in terms of the modern understanding of how we think the universe works it would not actually allow for this black hole to even exist or if it did exist it would probably break some laws of physics somewhere but also because black holes don't work like vacuum cleaners but actually work more like typical objects with typical mass in this case it's all about gravity so even an object that for example is your mass or let's just say just an average adult would not actually exert that much gravity on anything around it in order to absorb more mass or to add more mass to itself because the only way a black hole can increase in mass is if it actually starts adding more mass to itself through some sort of a collision but because of the tiny size of this particular black hole it would simply be incapable of touching anything or reaching anything its gravity is also very low so it's not going to be attracting anything either so even if a black hole was somehow created in some kind of a particle collider it would just be insignificant it would disappear without anyone ever knowing and that's actually why it's almost impossible to currently answer the question of whether these black holes have ever been made on planet earth even if they were created they disappeared before anyone noticed but also the question is could it be created well the answer to that is probably also no even though the collision energy between these particles is really high it's still relatively low as a matter of fact some of the natural particle accelerators such as various black holes various very powerful explosions somewhere out there in the universe produce particles with energy hundreds of millions of times higher than anything we can create here on planet earth and even natural particle accelerators in the magnetosphere of our planet created by the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar radiation creates something that's more powerful than we create in cern and so if black holes could be created anywhere they are more likely to be created around our planet not on it but even here we don't think it's happening at all and if it has ever been created on our planet or above our planet well there would be signs of this somewhere possibly signs of large explosions so large parts of matter missing or something as a matter of fact there was an article i discussed last year that briefly talked about the hypothetical scenario where costs could be colliding with our moon and there should be a way for us to detect them by using modern calculations of various craters so far nothing but still possible but if by some chance cern does create a black hole based on current calculations of the total mass used it would only be approximately 5 times 10 to the power of minus 20 grams once again creating a black code that's just impossible both in terms of the time data would exist and even in terms of the total size it's actually below the allowed total length it's lower than one plank length the small size the universe currently allows according to this calculator here is the smallest amount of material needed for black hole to actually exist in terms of the length and in this case is going to exist for a tiny tiny tiny fraction of the time it's equivalent to about 11 micrograms or the amount of material you sometimes find written on for example a vitamin pill bottle and that's way more material and way more total mass than the scientists actually use inside these particle accelerators because of the amount of energy required the total mass here is much much much much lower and as you can see from this calculation the total size of this black hole is also minuscule so there's absolutely no way it can ever affect anything around it now it might still be affected by gravity of planet earth but even as it travels through our planet it's unlikely to touch anything or unlikely to interact with any of the particles either but even if it did absorb some of the particles as it moved to the planet it would still only absorb several thousand different particles increasing its mass by just a tiny fraction in other words it would not turn into this super massive black hole that would destroy everything and if it keeps absorbing more and more mass as it travels through the planet it would actually take it a pretty long time before it becomes anything significant in order for this black hole to become large enough to finally affect anything around it you would probably need trillions and trillions of years of traveling through the planet and constantly absorbing mass but because of the hawking radiation it's most likely going to evaporate faster then it's going to have a chance to absorb something else and so in order to create a stable black hole that's going to exist long enough for it to start absorbing mass from the planet and to possibly even grow large and larger in size you would need to have an initial mass of at least several billion tons because without this mass is going to become unstable and then evaporate but if there is a black code that's several billion tons in mass in that case it can actually start absorbing mass around it and grow larger and larger something that the scientists think might exist out there something we refer to as primordial black hose and something the scientists have used to explain the hypothetical dark matter that might exist in the universe at the moment all this is still hypothetical and none of this is certainly known and since none of the particle accelerators on the planet can accelerate so much mass all at once creating anything similar to this and we don't actually have to worry about some kind of a black hole destroying planet earth at worst even if the black hole is created it's going to disappear before anyone can even notice but at best there's just not enough mass for the universe to even allow for this black hole to exist we can create other particles subatomic particles but we cannot create a black hole that's going to exist because either its total size or its total time of existence is beyond the plank length or the planck time the minimal length and the minimal time allowed by the universe itself and so that's why cern or other particle accelerators did not end the planet when they started operating but they did discover a lot of intriguing things and potentially even things violating modern physics at least modern understanding of physics and that's something i've discussed in one of the previous videos you can find on the channel or somewhere right there or also in the description below there's also this other video about the potential formation of neutron matter on the planet that you might want to take a look at as well it's somewhat different from what we've talked about today but it's related to the unusual exotic particles that the scientists are trying to create on the planet something that was also created in the particle accelerator but anyway on that note hopefully this answers your question so don't worry about black holes on planet earth probably not going to happen on that note thank you for watching subscribe

qEzDF9LSGQ4,13:59,en,true,true,ok,,"Very recently, I watched a video by Scott Manley where he posted his annual update of various asteroids that were found um in our solar system. So, actually, I decided to see if we can maybe simulate something similar in um Universe Sandbox 2 and then I was looking for what's already available and found this. This is Earth meets asteroids. Look at how beautiful this is going to be. I didn't even know this existed until I typed asteroid in Universe Sandbox 2. And okay, okay, okay. I didn't expect so much destruction, but I think we're all dead now. So, anyway, welcome to What the Math. [Music] [Music] And as we watch the rest of the earth gets destroyed, let me show you what I found here. Um, so what I wanted to see if we can actually try to simulate the actual realistic um, amount of asteroids in our solar system, at least according to Scott Manley's video where he actually indicated that by 2015, we have found something like 685,000 asteroids in our solar system, at least in between Mars and Jupiter. And I wanted to see if we can create that in this particular game. And then I started looking around. What else do we have here? We have something called um asteroid 20 uh 2014 RC which is actually really interesting. It's um an asteroid that passed by Earth really close to Earth about 10% the distance from Earth to the moon and um it sort of flew by right here and it unfortunately didn't hit any satellites or anything even though it passed by really close and it was about 23 m in size so it was relatively large. Uh but you know, it didn't hit us. And even if it did hit us, it would probably be something similar to what we've all seen uh on the videos from Russia when there was an asteroid that actually did uh land somewhere. So, if this asteroid had a slightly different trajectory, it could have actually passed by even closer or possibly even hit the Earth. So, let's see what happens if it actually does hit the Earth. We're going to put it on a collision course with Earth. And boom, it just bounced off. That's awesome. All right. Looks like it hit some of South American countries and nothing really happened. So, it's a it was a very small rock, very small asteroid that wouldn't really cause any damage. Now, we also have this other asteroid called Mr. Spock, which was actually uh named after Leonard Nemo's character, Mr. Spock from Star Trek, uh in I believe May of 2015 after he passed away. Uh, and so we now have one of the few asteroids named after fictional characters there. There aren't actually that many, but this is one of them. And this one is also located in the asteroid belt uh with the other asteroids that we're going to be simulating today. So it has a quite an interesting orbit that uh will probably never approach Earth at all. But then I found this really cool thingy called database database asteroids. So look at this. This is actually and it actually takes a while to load, but this is actually all of the named asteroids. Oh, so many of them. Let's remove the trail so we can see them. All of the named asteroids in our solar system as of I believe 2014. Um or at least most of them. So all of these asteroids, they have actual names. And these are all real things, real guys, real people, real asteroids. Uh it's much easier to see them if you click on chart. So you can actually see a grid. Uh because otherwise you'll have trouble seeing them. Let me just try to zoom out of here. Too bright. Too bright. Too bright. Sunburn. Uh here we go. So here comes an asteroid number one. Of course, the biggest one is Siri. Then we have Vesta. Then we have Palace or Palas if you're French. Uh Hyia and so on so forth. Psyche Davidida. And you can keep going and explore all of them and see how small and how big they are. Each of these guys has a name. And uh they're all named after some kind of a character, fictional or mythological or possibly even real people. I'm sure there are some that have been named after people that passed away now. So that's pretty cool. And I think there's over a hundred. There's probably a couple hundred of them here with the smallest one being this guy right here. And the name is Regahun Regina, I think. I don't know. Anyway, so that's uh that's cool. That's all nice and and uh and great, I guess. But that still doesn't really show us the magnificent uh number of asteroids that Scott Manley showed us in his video. So, I decided to let's make it let's make it from scratch. I'm going to go into the solar system and look at how puny this solar uh not solar sorry asteroid belt is. Okay, there's Vesta and series. There's a few maybe like 20 or so other asteroids that are flying there just for shows. But unfortunately, we don't have anything else. So, uh, and I I I'm pretty sure I know why we don't have anything else because, as you'll see as I'm making this, it it's going to stop to a crawl because there's just going to be too many objects to keep track of. So, let's make our own asteroid belt. Now, we're going to go into add here and into rings, and we're going to be adding rings of Saturn uh to our sun. So, uh, what I'm going to do is open advanced settings. Uh it doesn't really matter what you put in here, but what I'm going to make sure that I have is I want more mass. And also I want uh I want this to have well let's just start with something simple. Let's actually start with just the rings. We're going to put about 2500 of them. And we're going to be putting them in a very specific radius. So, let's just say um we're going to be putting them in between um Mercury and Mars because if you ever if you do watch his video, you'll see that there's actually quite a lot of them orbiting in that vicinity as well. Not too many, not a lot, not a lot a lot, but there are some. And so, we need to look at Mercury's semi- major axis, which is the distance to the sun. And it says here it's 57 million kilometers. So, we're going to put this value in a radius as let's just say about 60 million. But this is actually in meters, so it has to be in kilometers. And the outer radius is going to be at about 250 million km. So let's see if this works. We're going to add one ring. Tada. Look at that. Perfect. All right, so this is looking good. So far, the game is not too slow. We have still like maybe 40 frames per second. And this is already looking a little bit more realistic even though this is just a ring. So, I may actually want to add because uh they don't actually have a ring as much as they have something called uh Taurus. It's actually a Taurus, a Taurus shape, which is basically a donut. Think of it as a donut. So, we're going to add a donut shape as well. There we go. And now this is looking better. So, this is what we have on the inside. There's probably a little bit more than that, but just for the sakes of maintaining frames per second, we're going to leave it at that. So, this is in between Mercury and Mars. And uh there's quite a lot of them that do pass by really close to Earth. And so this is where the danger lies. Now let's work on the outer um I guess you can call it asteroid ring. And this is of course between Mars and Jupiter. And it only reaches about halfway the distance between Mars and Jupiter. So it kind of goes this way. So, uh, in between Mars and Jupiter, the distance is going to be from about 300 million kilm to approximately 600 million km. All right, let's test one ring. And boom. Okay, good. This is looking good. Maybe even a little bit more spread out. Actually, let's make this about 250 as well. Excellent. All right, so looking good. Now, this is only about 10,000 asteroids. I think I did this four times and I've been adding what? 2500. This is only 10,000 asteroids. In the Scott Manowway's video, he uh he at the end of the video, you can actually look at the number and the number is 685,731 asteroids as of 2015. I believe it's summer 2015. So, we're going to try that. We're going to actually add that number and get ready to uh see almost nothing because the game is about to have really, really, really, really slow speed. I'm going to actually just use this as a Taurus as well. And what we're doing here is well mass can stay the same. This is going to be I think the maximum you can add is 100,000 at a time. So here we go. This is going to be 100,000. Get ready. And boom. Boom. Okay. So this is donut number one. And I'm getting like three frames per second. And this is only the sixth of the entire amount. This is only the six. And what I wanted to do actually is while my game is still working, because I don't think I can even add anymore. We're going to add more at the end. But before we do that, let's actually try to go on Earth and stand on the surface and just see what it looks like if we could see every asteroid um or at least one six of them. What would it look like from the surface of Earth? Now, the game's already paused because it just doesn't process anymore because there's just way too many objects to control. Look at the sky here. I'm going to remove this so you can see everything. Look at the sky. This is only one6 as I said. Uh so I'm going to stand I just stand in Saudi Arabia for a second and look into the sky and what will we see? And look at that beauty. So all of those little spots that you see are little asteroids. And this is only this the fraction of what we would actually see in real life which we're going to try to simulate in one second. But this is basically approximately over 100,000 110,000 asteroids in the sky as they would appear from our planet if we could see every single one of them. Now the thing is we can't see them. We can only see them with really powerful telescopes because they're so tiny. But if we could somehow track them or if it was like really really really dark and they were really really shiny, this is what we would actually see in the sky. But you know what? Since we're going for realism here, and since Scott Manly showed us that it was more than that, let's add the rest. So, we're going to go back to our adding tool and create the big donut of asteroids around our solar system or around our sun in the asteroid belt. So, here comes 200,000 any second. Here comes 300,000. 400,000. 500,000 600,000 and we're going to make it 700,000 because it's actually 685. So, I'm sure they'll find more asteroids this year. Making it about 700,000 asteroids. Holy cow. I am getting one frame per second right now because there is ridiculously many asteroids to track. Now, you can probably see my mouse pointer, but that's really all I'm seeing right now, too. I tried to move the camera a little bit. Let's see if it works. Okay, so it is kind of moving really slowly, but this is basically the donut that would appear in the real solar system if it was really simulated in the game. Uh, you know, ignoring the fact that it's going to slow us to a crawl, this is what this donut looks like um in real life. And I'm going to try to maybe move a little bit to the side. All right. So, as I'm trying to zoom in here very very very slowly, you can kind of see the amount of asteroids present. But basically, yeah, this is just the inside uh basically the ring between Mars and Jupiter. But there's just as many of these guys in the outer solar system past Neptune. Uh probably even more actually. And this is of course the so-called um Kyper belt or sometimes known as Squippers Belt. Uh and of course there's the Urus cloud uh beyond that that has even more objects. So there's so many objects in our solar system that we don't even we can't even imagine the amount of stuff flying around there. So it's not just the planets, it's not just the few comets, it's not just the dwarf planets like Pluto and series, but it's all these little guys as well that make this a huge huge hugely populated system of various amount of stuff. And I was finally able to zoom in on our Earth just to see what it would look like again. And you can kind of see the asteroids in the background. It's literally just like, you know, some kind of a beach and full of sand and stuff. So, let's uh let's this time we're going to stand in Africa and look into the sky from Africa. And just so very very slowly, we're trying to lift our head up so we can see the beauty in the sky. And look at that. Look at all of these asteroids. Holy cow. There's a lot of stuff going on here. And of course, the game is totally frozen right now. I have not even advanced a second because it just in right now my computer is incapable of trying to calculate all of this motion in space. But this is what it would look like in its glory if it was frozen in time. Or actually, this is what you would probably see right now in the sky if you could see every single asteroid because they're not really moving that fast. So this is kind of the real um real picture that you would see. So there you have it. This is the asteroids and or just a part of the asteroids that you would see in the sky. And of course, this makes you wonder how tiny we are in this universe and how tiny we are even in our solar system because this is the amount of stuff that there is already present flying around and any of these asteroids if it actually came to visit our planet would cause some serious damage. So imagine that one of them suddenly deviates from its orbit and comes for a visit because a lot of them do have a mass uh big enough to cause serious damage."
Y8du5wXbt90,16:10,en,true,true,ok,,so this picture you see behind me this is a result of approximately 250 hours of direct observations by the James Webb Space Telescope part of a large survey by the James Webb that's actually meant as a kind of a general Observer program it doesn't have a specific purpose but it's very similar to what Hubble did a few decades ago similar to the iconic Ultra Deep Field but here we only see approximately 10 000 galaxies the image by the James web shows us at least three times as many and this is just the first such image it took less time to produce and it shows us so much more and we now even have this very beautiful animation created by NASA that shows us a simulated flight to a now famous Macy's Galaxy one of the most distant objects out there named after the discoverer's daughter Maisie this is at a distance of billions and billions of light years away from us when the universe was only a few hundred million years old would that really dim dotted you see essentially mean that unusual Galaxy and so yeah whole wonderful person this is Anton today we're going to be discussing some of the recent updates from the genes of Space Telescope mostly focusing on more unusual unexpected discoveries from the super super distant Universe some discoveries that still make no sense but also some discoveries that sort of reveal things we kind of expected and here's one such image something that we knew we're going to find at some point the image of earliest Galactic Collision ever found this happened when the universe was about 500 million years old intriguing shown us two somewhat different galaxies one is much Bluer and contains a lot of young baby stars and War of star formation whereas the other one seems to be red contains a hour of dust and not a lot of new stars with one on the galaxies at least 10 million years younger than the other and this discovery beats the previous record of Galactic collision by at least 300 million years but discovering Galactic collisions so early on and possibly finding a lot of them was of course always expected in some sense confirming a lot of cosmological theories when it comes to Galactic Evolution but a much more exciting discovery of something that was expected but was still surprising is right here would each circle representing one of 10 Galaxies existing when the universe was about 830 million years old now why is this exciting what are we possibly looking for well based on the current analysis the conclusion here is that we're looking at one of the threads of the mysterious Cosmic web specifically a thread that's about 3 million light years in length and that seems to be connected to an ancient Quasar a galaxy with a very active supermassive black hole on the inside now the cosmic web by itself is a major prediction of a lot of modern theories but it's not until the last few years that we actually started finding physical evidence for it in a lot of different images there's at least one video in the description that explains soundness evidence in more detail but in this case what it seems to show us is a filament that might eventually evolve into a massive Galactic cluster with galaxies currently approaching one another along the filament itself possibly serving as a formation theory for various massive Galactic clusters such as the famous coma cluster and so in this case this is basically one of the earliest filamentary structures that seems to be directly associated with the ancient Cosmic web and it seems to be really thin and very long as I mentioned three million light years in length so definitely a solid uneural Discovery even though technically theoretically it was predicted a long time ago but in the last few months some of the most exciting his Currys were really in regards to black holes pretty much every single week dozens and dozens of new black holes have been revealed by new observations with Scientists now suggesting that we've discovered at least 10 times as many black holes as everyone expected compared to what we used to have a few years ago although in this case we're only talking about really really massive black holes Central black holes in various galaxies so obviously black holes like this one that would form a quasar or any other black hole that's usually referred to as an active Galactic nucleus AGN and so why exactly there seems to be 10 times as many as everyone expected that's the mystery for now I think this study right here sort of summarizes everything in a lot of detail but here are just some of these new images shown us each of these black holes at a relatively far away distance they basically look like extremely bright infrared gloves but specifically blobs that seem to be different from the surrounding Galaxy and so the further analysis using spectroscopy can easily reveal if the brightness here comes from the black hole or from various stars in the galaxy and so looks like a lot of this super heated gas in many galaxies does come from these very powerful black holes and intriguingly many different discoveries in the last few months involved a lot of record holders as well the biggest story though is probably this year's 1019 an extremely distant early Galaxy that contains a relatively massive black hole in the center here the universe was only about 570 million years old and strangely enough this galaxy appears as these three bright clumps implying that it's still assembling itself and does not have a disc or any structure it's also very likely forming Stars really quickly with the black hole growing fast as well at the same time the total mass of the black hole is approximately 9 million solar masses twice as massive as the one in the center of our own Galaxy and the reason this black hole is visible to us is probably because of some kind of a galactic Collision that happened here relatively recently and so strangely enough the calculations here suggests that this black hole is growing at the fastest possible speed it cannot possibly grow any faster that was theoretically based on what we know about black holes which is of course why it's also so bright and so easily visible but in terms of mass it's not particularly massive when it comes to large black holes approximately two years ago even before the game's well there was a discovery of a blackout it's about 1.6 billion solar masses hundreds of times more massive than this one when the universe was just 670 million years old now that Discovery is still difficult to explain it actually sort of violates what's known as the Addington limit suggesting that we just don't understand exactly how massive black holes form a lot of these ideas are still based on somewhat outdated principles and we even have some of the new discoveries that you can learn more about in the description that actually explain how certain massive black holes can form extremely quickly without breaking any rules and so the discovery of these unusual black holes though unusual definitely does not break anything major but intriguing even just a few weeks ago there was a potential discovery of a massive black hole even farther away redshift of about 12. but all this hinting on the fact that some of the observations imply that our theories definitely need to be changed just a little bit not only do these black holes seem to grow to large sizes really quickly there seem to be at least 10 times more of them discovered by the James lab and the most recent discovery was from the paper that you see right here in regards to an extremely bright x-ray object known as uhz1 here the redshift is approximately 10 so it's slightly closer to us but it seems to represent some kind of a very unusual black hole because it seems to lack certain signatures we expect from an active Galactic nucleus and one property that makes this black hole somewhat unusual is actually the fact that we don't see much a lot of things seem to be hidden which actually implies that there is quite a lot of dust present here that seems to hide a lot of the emissions and the main conclusion in this paper is actually the fact that this might help us answer how these black holes become so massive this idea is usually referred to as the seating model and these seeds can actually be anything they could be really really massive stars early Stars such as population 3 stars possibly thousands of solar masses in mass or they could also be chunks of dark matter but in this case this particular galaxy has a really high chance of potentially answering many of these questions with many of these other black holes providing more evidence and more explanations for what exactly allowed them to become so big so quick but we'll talk more about this once there are actually some answers but then we have this other unusual mystery that really no one expected coming from a very visible Galaxy at a red shift of seven and here it was a discovery of carbon specifically carbon-based molecules or carbon-rich dust grains okay Coco cool why does carbon matter at all well it's not why it matters it's I guess when it matters sound is complex organic molecules technically should not exist yet for example in R1 Galaxy the most common discovery of carbon molecules in most star-forming regions involve what's known as pah polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons something we usually find in the middle of various molecular clouds something that we also associate with formation of planets and stars and of course potentially complex life it's usually found in various birthplaces for many different planets and stars and it seems to be responsible for the evolution of various galaxies ironically in astronomy it's also a bit of an issue it absorbs a lot of wavelings and so it actually makes things a little bit difficult to observe if for example you're trying to look through the whole galaxy with a lot of these carbon molecules absorbing a lot of light and so what's the big deal of discovering this with the jeans whatever well the thing is these complex organic molecules these cyclical molecules are not thought to have existed within the first billion years of the existence of the universe hours we definitely had carbon we just didn't have complex organic molecules yet Modern Chemistry predicts that it would take at least several hundred million years to potentially form even the simpler molecules and so discovering polysacchoic carbons in very early universe is definitely a bit mysterious naturally this is where a war of naysiers are going to start saying maybe this means that the universe is actually much older or the Big Bang never happened and so on and so forth but that's not the explanation that we currently have for this as a matter of fact the current explanation is way more intriguing and it relies on my new detail and extremely accurate measurements of certain frequencies so basically here it really depends on how this was found and so in previous research by looking at galaxies much closer to us up to redshift of about three a lot of spectroscopic observations often observed similar molecules at a frequency of approximately 217.5 nanometers so basically if you see an absorption at this freaking can see it's probably coming from various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but the observations from this particular Galaxy were picking at a wavelength of 226.3 nanometers suggesting that this was maybe carbon based but not exactly what we expected to be or that it was some kind of a carbon dust that used to exist here that didn't form the same complex molecules just yet essentially early Universe Cosmic dust dust that could be easily produced by many different early stars go in Supernova and forming early carbon that then mixed with oxygen and other elements to start forming extremely early organic compounds and at the moment this is the most likely explanation which also implies that the early Universe had extremely different chemistry compared to anything we have today it also implies that the planetary formation and star formation was probably somewhat different we don't really know how different just different although this particular wavelength could also be produced by something more simple maybe various graphite formations created by complex carbon without any organic molecules so basically here we're looking at some kind of a super early complex carbon dust either way though super exciting and something we're going to be discussing more once there is maybe some conclusion some explanation or additional observations from future studies and then there was this an actual physical observation of a collision of two neutron stars resulting in a powerful kilo Nova Now by itself this is not the first time we've seen Neutron Star Collision but it's the first time it was seen by the Indian's web detected through a very powerful gamma-ray burst that was seen in March of 2023 and the main Discovery here was the detection of various very heavy elements specifically 15 Metals heavier than a lead whose existence before was a bit mysterious but has now been attributed to a Neutron Star Collision for example heavy elements like tilu rim and various types of lanthanides this was about 8.3 million light years away from planet Earth but strangely enough approximately 130 000 light years away from the nearest galaxy so technically this could have come from somewhere entirely different unfortunately during this time the gradational detector ligo was not operational so we don't really have more details but nevertheless the discovery by itself is already pretty impressive especially because this is not even the first kill Anova or supernova seen by the James web completely by accident here's another one that happened in 2022 and this one was surprisingly a result of a gravitational lens and located billions and billions of light years away so I'm sure we'll be seeing more of these in the next few months looks like Gene swap is just good at attacking everything at this point now not sure there was some other discoveries including discoveries from R1 Galaxy but we'll discuss this more in a separate video in the future specifically the discovery coming from this image of the strange object you see in the middle and the weird question mark you see right there what is this huh you'll find out soon so subscribe share this with someone who other space and Sciences come back tomorrow to learn something else thank you so much for watching and maybe support this channel on patreon by doing Channel membership t-shirt you can find in the description it does have jeans web as one of the designs stay wonderful I'll see you tomorrow and as always bye [Music] [Music] thank you foreign foreign
FmAwxeVJU9I,32:13,en,true,true,ok,,"hello wonderful person this is Anton and this is actually going to be a pre-recorded video of a let's play of a space game that I may have taken a look at previously I'm actually away right now for about 8 to 9 days visiting a relative who doesn't believe in Internet unfortunately so I can't really uh upload videos from here for this reason I decided to pre- upload a bunch of stuff and this is going to be one of those pre-up loaded videos enjoy it hopefully you like it and I'll see you when I come back space out anyway so we have to cut off our main engines um and yeah so this is so cool look at that zero g effect not many games give you that huh uh all right all right all right oh it's here right very good and then ignite second stage so now we're going to be transferring to the moon's orbit I believe uh from what I remember we're not actually transferring into the orbit because they've build an um an almost like a space elevator like construction where do I press here yeah okay which is actually super difficult because of um I think I made a video about this a long time ago um to build a space elevator on the moon you kind of have to um reach way way past the moon okay it's kind of difficult to explain but basically because the moon doesn't spin very fast the space elevator would not be very easy to build it's much easier on Earth actually one day I really should make a very extensive video on Space elevators and explain how this works there's a um a really awesome Japanese paper written about this from a few years ago where they actually show you like every detail every single detail of how to build a success for space elevator with the only thing missing Lally the only thing we can't really do yet for space elevators is that we need to build a cable that's going to be about 80,000 km long and not re re apart it has to be has to have a very very high um tensile strength yeah so there you go there is a space elevator to the Moon uh the last I've heard is that they were trying to see if the um type of a polymer meat from spider silk can actually be good enough but apparently even spider silk is not strong enough so we need something stronger all righty all righty righty Al righty objective dock to the station okay so this is where I actually stopped last time I remember the the docking part was super fun it's actually like kind of like a curbal space programming where you have to yeah see you have to like align yourself with the docking I'm going to say ho but I'm sure it has a more scientific name which uh it's a dog in Port but hole sounds cooler okay so how do I oh move down control and then there's also radar right that's going to notify me if I'm going too fast so this is kind of cool this is basically kind of like how it really works in um in space when they do to the ISS for example obviously maybe not as simple in terms of controls also it's usually automated nowadays the uh the Russians actually developed a very very extensive docking procedure that basically is completely automated and is perfectly safe you only need to rely on the manual when something goes absolutely horribly wrong and it hasn't happened in in in decades as far as I remember unless they haven't told us it's very possible maybe something did happen there's actually a really uh kind of a dramatized version of a space movie called I believe it's called salute because it's about the salute station the Soviet station that was um that lost control a few decades ago and it was actually about to crash onto the US soil but the I think it was still Soviet Union the Soviets or maybe it was already Russia I don't remember um the actually they figured out how to um execute this really complex docking maneuver and they were able to save it they were actually able to stabilize the station and save the station and even send astronuts there afterwards it was a ridiculous maneuver an almost impossible feat but that's probably because they didn't want to kind of um disappoint their American counterparts all right so that was cool very short segment hopefully we'll get more of these but very cool segment all right so we are now in Zerg you must haveed of space station by now the storm has severely damaged our instrument so we can't reach your location or receive any messages but we can detect fluctuations from the MPT network if you can hear this when you reach the control center try to find out what's wrong with the MPT connection so you can bring it back online good luck I thought you're never going to talk to me again Claire we agreed from now on it just me and myself me and my inner thoughts I need some peace we need some time apart you know you know what I'm saying Claire stop stop it just stop it let me let me enjoy this this is nice and peaceful look at this you know zero g around the Moon absolutely quiet and so so cool like this looks amazing 5 Years After the Blackout oh that's what Pearson is it's a space station oh oh it's a space station above the Moon now it makes sense that's what the painting uh that's what the picture was showing cannot go here um this actually kind of reminds me of that other game called a drift I don't you've probably heard or seen it before it was supposed to be like a VR game and um I actually made several videos of a drift um and was going to post it on a channel couple of years ago go and then um I got to try it in VR even I got to actually play it in VR at someone's uh someone else's computer and the thing is it's the first time ever that I actually felt uh I felt sick playing the game uh physically sick the like so okay imagine doing this and I'm sure some of you may be already feeling kind of queasy but doing this in that game and also specifically in VR gives you such an uncomfortable feeling it's just it's really weird and I wonder if I'm maybe one of the minority of people experiencing this cuz I never really get sick from um physically sick from playing video games but I I could not could not even continue I could not finish it so I abandoned the playthrough I don't know how the game ends I just couldn't do it and I'm already stuck I'm just bumping against the walls here wait a second that is not how Earth looks from this distance oh wait no we're not on the moon yet so it makes sense I guess we're somewhere between the Earth and the moon um what am I doing a loock oh that's what I'm doing wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what what's happening no no close it close it why why is O oxygen depleting huh so I have only have 3 minutes to do whatever I need to do oh no oh no oh no station power low tab objective okay bring life support systems back on line um how how do I do that is it here is anything here no nothing is here okay where is the life support what is this this looks like life supporty grab it take with us I'm sure we'll need it at some point I have a good feeling about this it's blue canister blue means good right all right Central Hub I only have 2 minutes oh crap oh crap oh no no no no no what is this interact oh yeah I did it I was right I was right about the blue thing elevator ofline what is this it's yellow oh this is oxygen okay so I'm not it's not so bad uh why do I only have 3 minutes that's so unfair all right uh reboot reboot yes press the reboot button no not enough power uh power power is here what is this how do I fix this what do I what do I plug in there another one of those blue thingies oh it's a battery the blue thing is a battery that makes total sense I could have figured this out a long time ago this is a oxygen let's take one more oh I found an oxygen thingy oh I'm safe now oh my God look at all this oxygen guys we're fine is that space maybe that's maybe space I don't know what kind of a Eva Su you're wearing but why does it have so little oxygen in it that's ridiculous who made this did you three print this in your Maker Camp okay I need this battery right yeah yeah yeah there we go there we go there we go grab it and put it in the thiny a how relatively simple the puzzles are so far I don't have to like look around for things for hours and it's pretty intuitive like you just go in here you plug the thing and then you probably go and press the reboot button wait that was just one how many do I need shoot I need one more right yeah yeah yeah I need one more okay I need some oxygen I don't think I saw another one oh okay my flashlight also has power I did not know that I just realized there's a power on on the bottom there okay I may need to take one more oh Jesus I need to take one more is there one in here no no there's nothing here well what where is it I mean they're pretty easy to see how could I have missed it h oh do I just pick this one can I take it out maybe I can just take it out right ah come on wh what is this it's not fair why why does this door need need the thing to be open like how does it make any sense I don't think it makes any sense please be in here please be in here no it's more oxygen uh none of these open right does this open nope this also does not open okay then Jesus Christ oh wow this looks amazing look at that oh the Moon is right there I did not even see that oh this game is just glorious it's amazing I'm telling you anyway oh I can take this one oh I see I see I see all right so that totally makes sense so this is the one from no wait that doesn't make sense what oh oh I get it oh my God this is all I had to do are you serious put this in here this will keep the door open now take this one from here oh Jesus now now I see now I see what I have to do well that only took me about 10 minutes of my life here on the station all right here we go that's that's probably it right okay okay here we go and now I can go in here and reboot yay power support systems on all right okay last time I heard something like this um that was an alien isolation and then certain monsters started coming out I hope that's not what this game has I really hope there's no monsters here I do not want to see any monsters in this game all right um uhuh now what access station power inside the control center in the Libra Wing I don't know where that is you didn't give me any Maps but everything is working right oh no station power very very low but we have oxygen which is good we don't have any MPT Network oh yeah that's what we're here to fix so that kind of makes sense so here we go all right so you are here right you have to be here sweeping quarters and control center this map is really not helping how is this supposed to help me worst map ever that's not where I go I guess we'll go back right wait but did I close this door okay I need to remember this is in three dimensions so I have to actually start looking like above and below as well so maybe there's a door I'm missing somewhere oh I found a package what's this to capica moonhub as Parts I believe AC refers to those like um cryogenic igis right that failed we still don't really know exactly what happened in there but that's kind of the Assumption right now um okay do I have to remove the battery again but that will disable the thing no well let's try I can't it won't let me right I don't think I can huh I'm already stuck again I I was just stuck like a few seconds ago why am I stuck again whoa look at that there's actually dust on the screen that is crazy can you see the dust from like you know the station being abandoned that's insane like I told you the amount of detail here spectacular seal of approval and also uh look at the look at the vista look at the view that's crazy you can literally see the moon if I stay here long enough I think we'll see no no we don't see I thought we're actually orbiting but I forgot it's a space elevator it's supposed to be above the same spot that's the purpose of a space elevator oh and there goes my flashlight okay so I am stuck I'm going to go and figure things out and come back when I figure them out oh my God are you serious it was right here the entrance was right here it was like literally it opened up below me how how did I not see this if you're screaming in chat in the comments below right now saying that you know I am not very intelligent and things of that nature I deserve it because I just didn't see it it was not very observant oh look at that music drama intensity I think I just sa I think the game just saved which is great because I have not save the game at all since the beginning I really should huh um okay we are going to see what this is and this is nothing we are then going to go and see what this is no nothing it is so difficult to orient yourself in three dimensions it's insane like people are not designed for this I don't know how we're going to go explore the space we're just not ready okay let's let's go here I think this is what we have to do Okay let's listen Expedition team do you copy copy control we're all set ready for descent the MPT network is still down so expect the lights to go out as you descend towards cernus thanks for the heads up Pearson remember Sarah our oxygen here in the station is limited after arriving you'll have 40 minutes to find out what caused the blackout and bring our MPT Network back online if you're not back by then we'll have to evacuate without you we hear your control Rolf you ready I am and don't worry control it's probably just a glitch we'll be back before you know it let's find out how they've been holding up down there Alex commence descend protocol all systems Go Des 2 1 so that answers the question of us not being roll fighter we're not Rolf and that basically means that Fortuna is our name who named me Fortuna that's pretty cool um so this is literally the elevator to the moon but it's offline right yeah so we can't use it and to use this or to activate this we need to do have to give it voltage again I guess maybe we'll have to find another one of those batteries okay okay okay okay okay um I haven't seen any flying around but I also haven't really explored very thoroughly I don't even know if I've been here before Oh my God this is so disorienting you know for a person that basically literally explains space stuff like 24/7 I am absolutely horrible at navigating in actual three dimensions in space what did that do okay but why but but why no but but but why why did I do this I like this better you get to see stuff okay I don't know where to go I mean I kind of get the point right that we have to assess station power inside the control center oh okay so we need to actually keep going we need to keep going to the Libra station I really wish they had like signs or something for people like me that do not Orient very well in three dimensiones oh it says Alex is Alex outside is Alex dead oh who's Alex okay so once again kind of stuck and and this time you're going to have to be stuck with me I I'm going to make you stuck with me we're going to be stuck together that's why it's called let's play we're going to Let's Play Stuck Together um oh so oh oh I see okay now makes sense we have to go to number three so it's connected to the circle thing in the middle we're in a circle thing in the middle so one of these little hole thingies is going to lead us to number three right there you go light Libra Libra Libra it's Libra but I think it's spelled Libra so it's a little bit confusing oh I got confused by the color I thought I was coming from here but I I don't think I came from here before right okay I think this is all new yeah yeah definitely new because there's a uh another one of those voice messages whoa something just hit me and look at that everything's fine who did that who did that this better not turn into alien isolation suddenly all right so now that we are kind of here let's go to the toilet we haven't been in a while let's use the bathroom come on open damn it I just wanted to see what the bathroom looks like okay a monoral delay could cost lives oh Rolf we found rolf's house and Sarah how how come they have their own uh cabins all right there you go buddy almost there we'll touch up your paint job later don't worry are you ready to go we've almost got the elevator running again yeah just patching up Alex before we head down are you bringing that thing along of course we'll need all the help we can get and besides he wouldn't have made it to that airlock if it hadn't been for him this MPT blackout can't be just a glitch rol everything is still dark down there last time there was an outage did you hear the message from Earth no aliens what did they say they can't even send ship sh up here anymore without the MPT it's crazy right we're the only ones able to investigate the blackout Sarah we need to get you guys down to the surface ASAP we don't have much time okay let's go all right so now we know Alex is not a person I think it's a robot I think cuz she was repairing it danger electrical shock risk uh huh ASC that's part of that uh cryogenic thing no council member laverie the Mt is still offline what's going on Bea power is finally riding up here at the station and repairing the Pearson elevator to take us down to capus moonhub to provide any assistance you might need to bring the MPT back online we're coming please be safe Sarah Baker Pearson station engineer so I think uh they were they're clearly were the first team to go here to try to repair stuff and as we can see from the damage did not work things did not work cool very cool design of the cabin don't know what that is so okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay nothing else here what is this looks like a well um welding map mask right or something of that nature and I think maybe we cannot go here we're going to go explore rols cabin because I pretty sure that's where we're going to find out the password right makes sense okay so okay they don't really need an actual bed to sleep though do they why do they actually have an actual bed moonman first Contact is this a foreshadowing are you saying there is going to be a first Contact because if so very cool the astronaut docks into rundown space station on his way to the Moon in it he discovers the C of an old friend convinced that they may still be alive on the moon he doubles his efforts to reactivate the space elevator in a Race Against Time cool very cool very very very awesome so oh oh I can actually look at the Earth right oh my God look at this this is awesome also there's still a bit of light here and there so there they do have energy from something they're still surviving obviously not as much as we used to have or as they used to have we still have quite a lot um hble right no yeah looks a little bit off in terms of Dimensions this looks a little bit thicker than it should be I have my little Lego Hubble right right next to me a Lego model of Hubble what's this um cryos Machinery after the cryos generator and the hens research facility malfunction in 2048 Maria search for answers led her to investigate What Remain of the machine unable to determine the exact cause of the malfunction she sent the fragment to Pearson space station mechanic Ral Robertson for assessments so I guess we're going to you discover what's up I'm one of the few survivors of the hens cry s Mal function I recently came across a fragment recovered from the Cryer generator and was hoping you could inspect it also is there any way I can get my ASC to project holographic data from that day I want to find out what really happened Maria Gonzalez Dear Miss Gonzalez I've inspected the generator fragment you sent over but I can't find anything conclusive as far as holographic data it's unfortunately located based it's unfortunately location based h s can only be projected where they occurred if the lunar Council ever clears access to higens again I think the best thing to do is to bring your ASC and to check the holographic data that's there okay so sounds like the answer she's looking for oh there we go 2539 2539 2539 sounds like the answers are on that thingy that we saw so we might as well bring it with us whoa I'm getting dizzy collect what oh this oh okay yeah okay we can't take it with us unfortunately I thought maybe we can take it with us and maybe at some point we can use it at that thingy that he mentioned uh but we can't 2 5 39 this is like the least secure facility in the world W looks cool but massive too big too big to explore all right um never go out without ASC by site so what's ASC I don't really understand the purpose of that thing I think it's some sort of a data keeping device that keeps track of what's happening around you essentially it logs the information of what's Happening um council member McArthur in the past few months my team and I have encountered problems with construction material shipments we were supposed to be finished with the Orion Wing by now but again we've missed our Milestone due to the shipment being repeatedly cancelled when can we expect the ler Council to approve further shipments Sarah Baker engineer Baker the lunar Council has decided to shift resource priorities around because of new construction on the moon for the time being I recommend you make do with what you have we we all do down here council member MC new construction is the hens facility finally being repaired it's about time that place opened up again there's too much knowledge buried there since the chry with malfunction engineer breaker suffice it to say that while a construction project is classified it does not concern hens access to the hens research facility remains restricted until further notice so it sounds like there is something secret going on on the moon they were constructing something and that may be what malfunctioned okay cool Co cool cool Co cool cool cool let's move on with our lives and here is we have nothing everything is broken right oh no never mind uh a Ryan Wing I can read it right but that's useless to us and oh my God there's too much stuff here all right let's uh let's see if we find something useful I feel like there's going to be a lot of stuff that's just kind of fillers which I really love personally but I'm sure not everyone watching this video will appreciate get it um this is evacuation procedures we don't really need that right oh wait maybe we do anything important here no I don't think so I don't think there's anything important can I click anything here no so I think we're here to to fix the elevator right this is the elevator controls but I don't see anything interactable just yet what's this we interview lunar council member Lo Rosel Aver about the cause of 2014 a hens crisis with malfunction and how can we avoid this type of catastrophe in the future and we still don't really know what happened and this is generic chips the only chips on the space station no brand names allowed uh I guess we just go into that the last area that we have which is this oh we need a password we don't have a password no this doesn't even open right no it doesn't open it's an a walk oh it's under construction oh this is the Orion oh look at that I I see my own shadow that's so cool wow legs legs okay that actually kind of scared me for a second I mean I'm having like nightmares since alen isolation cannot play any space game and it's funny because I actually finished that space like way way before alien insolation I just could not handle Al alien insolation that game is terrifying cannot do it will do it at some point but it's really hard it's not like difficult hard but it's just terrifying um and it's terrifying if you play like me like as you can see I'm very thorough I kind of like go through every nuke and cranny I don't want I don't like missing things I like reading short tidbits here and there I kind of like to really engulf myself in the story unless that story is about an alien stalking me like literally 24/7 and that's that's a problem so is there something I missed here well wonderful person hopefully you enjoy this part there's going to be another one coming to tomorrow and uh there's also going to be a few videos that I pre-recorded in advance coming in between these videos just so that you have something else to watch once in a while like I said I'm going to be back soon but basically enjoy this and see you tomorrow"
CQdbhHU-6rE,11:08,en,true,true,ok,,"hello wonderful person this is Anton and today I wanted to talk about a new discovery of potentially six more exomoons or moons of exoplanets somewhere out there that we may have just discovered and also I wanted to discuss some of the other exome ones will discover it in the past as well let's talk about this and welcome to our math so as of right now we've discovered four thousand 171 exoplanets that have been confirmed with a few thousand more being investigated as potential exoplanets as well in other words we got exceptionally good at detecting various exoplanets out there and most of them were actually found in this way by looking at the star and by seeing this very specific and also very periodic tip that happens as the planet passes in front of the star this is the most common method of finding exoplanets but this method has now also been kind of employed to try to discover various excellence as well and as you can probably imagine if other star systems are engineering like our own solar system then even though we have eight planets there might still be hundreds and even thousands of various moons orbiting around these planets but because of their size they don't exert enough gravitational effects or enough dip when passing in front of the star for us to truly see them with modern current telescopes there are several telescopes that are being researched right now that could potentially detect him in the future but for now we don't really have anything so detecting any EXO moon right now is absolutely incredible simply because of how difficult areas to do one of the more obvious detections was actually around this gigantic planet with extremely enormous rings known as G 1407 here when the planet was discovered and when we discovered its rings the assumption was that inside of these rings most likely inside of some of the larger gaps here there might be some moons as well we didn't really directly see the moons but we implied their existence through the existence of some of these really large gaps current assumption is that there are at least two exomoons here but it's also very likely that there are hundreds if not thousands of accidents present around this tremendous very unusual and exceptionally unique planet another really unusual detection was back in 2014 and this was of a rogue planet a free-floating planet that doesn't have any stars that seems to have an object orbiting around it and because this object is not really a brown dwarf it's basically an object that's more massive than Jupiter but less massive than 13 masses of Jupiter and because it had an object or between in its orbit we can truly call this a star system this is a rogue planetary system also known as plenum oh and this object did seem to have a moon around it and so this is one of the more unusual exomoons who discovered a rogue planet with an excellent that it was most likely kicked out of a star system long long time ago another really unusual detection was in regards to this object here known as was 49b a few years ago the scientists detected an extremely strange envelope of sodium orbiting around this planet as well and to scientist it meant that something was emitting a lot of sodium but probably not the planet itself they looked at some of the examples from the solar system and realized it was 49 B could have an object similar to IO the moon of Jupiter that is volcanic in nature and that's emitting all of the sodium and essentially that's what they detected a few years ago but currently there's no way to prove if it's a moon that's causing this or something else the assumption here is that it's probably the moon but we don't really know exactly what caused all this sodium to be emitted but one of the more original ways of detecting AXA moons focuses on trying to capture the light reflected by the planet itself as it orbits the star so as the moon orbits around the planet it will most likely cause the changes in the light that we detect coming from the planet and this detection if it's periodic especially can be associated with potentially moons orbiting in the system one such system is right here this is what's 12 B where a few years ago scientists may have detected an X and when in the orbit of this planet another one is right here this is a planet known as HD 1897 33 B and what are these planets as you can see are extremely close to their parent stars so they have to be really easily visible and have to already emit a lot of light as we get this reflection when the planet is on the other side of the star system and as a moon passes in front of this planet we should see a very periodic dip here as well in other words to help you visualize all of this if this is the system with the star and the planet being relatively close to one another here the planet will be bright enough to emit its own light as well because of the heat produced by the star and at some point you'll see that there is a tiny tiny shadow from the moon passing in front of the planet that will actually cause the dip around the planet and this dip right here this shadow on the planet can potentially serve as a way for us to detect accidents but another way of seeing these accidents is if the moon itself is massive enough to then pull on the planet and to cause it to wobble a little bit in its orbit and in this simulation from the Canadian researchers behind the recent paper you can kind of see what it means as the planet orbits around the star and as the moon orbits around the planet it creates these periodic motions of the planet that can be visible in the light will receive from the EXO planetary system and because of these periodic observations the scientist behind this paper believe they discovered six more exomoons out there in other words we might have another method of detecting exomoons even better than before this particular method can be used to detect a lot of other similar objects and it does seem to be a more robust method that allows us to see the action of the AXA moon on the exoplanet so this is a much more direct method of detection of exomoons compared to previous methods mentions it's also somewhat similar to the methods we use to detect other exoplanets known as a radial velocity method where we actually see the wobble itself when the exoplanet causes a slight changes in the light of a star but here we're observing these effects on the planetary light received so in other words this method can be now adapted to much smaller objects objects that are usually very very difficult to see otherwise and the method that they use to detect this is known as transit timing variation here is a brief simulation that will explain to you how all this works in this case it's an example of an exoplanet and a star and you see that as this planet moves around the star if there is nothing in orbit of this planet at the time that it passes in front of a star will always be the same however if we now have another object that's not visible to us orbiting around the star system the transit variations will be a lot more and because there is now a gravitational pull on this planet and we'll see these gravitational transit variations happen with a very very specific periodicity in other words we can now deduce that something is pulling on this planet and although in this case it's clearly an exoplanet we haven't discovered yet it can also be done by a much smaller exomoons and the so called ttv or transit timing variations will be a lot smaller but also a lot more frequent the Salone is to estimate what kind of a moon it is but obviously as this simulation here shows technically it could also be maybe other planets even though the best explanation right now are the axial moons it could also be unusual exoplanets in a very very unique orbits this is very unlikely right now but it is possible although because of the observations and because of the frequency of these T TV's it's very very likely to be an axial moon and not an exoplanet and all of the exoplanets and exomoons involved here are actually kind of far away from us anywhere from two hundred to about 2,000 light-years away from us all of these Kepler systems were discovered by the Kepler telescope a few years ago and pretty much all of them have been already investigated and all of them had these confirmed exoplanets but obviously none of them were investigated for potential exomoons and you in their investigation these scientists discovered two more objects that also possess transit time in variations but now the scientists believe that those two are actually caused by invisible exoplanets it's unlikely to be accidents it's more likely to be planets we haven't found yet so essentially the scientists behind the study discovered 6xo moons and most likely two more planets somewhere out there and with so many new exciting techniques to discover these previously invisible objects to us it's actually kind of fascinating to find out how the scientists are able to see all this and did use all of this even though the original data was collected almost a decade ago but unfortunately we can truly see any of these objects just yet and none of the current telescopes are able to detect exomoons either so unfortunately we're not going to be able to know if these EXA moons are similar to for example Titan to IO to any of the other interesting moons in our source system and we're definitely not going to know if they have liquid water and oceans inside of them either although a lot of these moons because there is so close to the parent star are very likely extremely hot and most likely just as inhospitable and just as hot as the planets that they orbit nevertheless it's really exciting to hear about these discoveries because the techniques are extremely clever but anyway until we discover more exomoons or something else about these particular exoplanetary systems that's all I want to mention in this video thank you for watching subscribe it is - Hammond share this was so cool of

CPBJgpK0Ulc,13:23,en,false,true,ok,,"Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. A few years ago in Minneapolis an angry dad stormed into the retail store Target. His daughter, a high schooler, had been receiving coupons in the mail from the store for things like cribs and diapers. Was Target encouraging his daughter, a minor, to go out and get pregnant? well Well, the store apologized but a few days later they heard back from the father. He told them ""a few things have been going on in my household I was unaware of. My daughter is due in August. I owe you an apology."" You see, Target's internal algorithms have been tracking and processing his daughter's purchases and recently she'd started buying different items than usual. Things like certain vitamin supplements and scent-free soaps and lotions. Behaviors the system flagged as evidence she could be pregnant, thus they her sent the coupons. And they were right. Without being told, Target knew that a girl was pregnant before her own father. We are tracked and followed digitally now more than ever before. We live in a world of 24/7 CCTV, browser cookies, trackable debit cards and cell phones and GPS, fingerprinting and DNA analysis. But despite all of that, every single year in the United States alone more than 2,000 people disappear and are never found again dead or alive. Where do missing people go? How did they disappear? What if you disappeared and how do you know you haven't already disappeared? In many cases, missing persons are the victims of unsolved or unknown crimes. They may have suffered accidents or taken their own lives and their bodies were never found. Or they may be perfectly fine and have simply escaped their old life, old friends and family, old debt and obligations to start a new life somewhere else, possibly as someone else. How long would it take for people to notice if you disappeared? Well, think about it. I mean, it sort of depends on who you are, how you live and how you disappeared. In most jurisdictions after about five to seven years, if no one has heard anything from you at all, you can be declared dead in absentia. This is what happened to French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil. In the 18th century hundreds of people traveled far and wide to observe the transit of Venus from different locations on earth. They knew that by comparing their measurements they could calculate more accurately than ever before just how far away the Sun was. So, Le Gentil left Paris in 1760 for Pondicherry in India. But after a storm blew him off course and the British occupied Pondicherry, he was forced to spend the day of the transit on a boat at sea, which rocked too much for accurate measurements to be taken. Now, the next transit would happen in 8 years. But after that, the next next transit wouldn't happen for another 100 years. So, he stuck around. He didn't return to Paris. Instead, he built an observatory and waited. When he finally returned to Paris, 11 years after leaving, he found that he had been declared dead. His wife had remarried, his family had plundered  his belongings and his position at the Royal Academy of Sciences had been given to someone else. He never did see the transit of Venus, by the way. On the day that it happened, the sky above him was overcast. We know the human population of Earth. Kind of. Population figures and counters are only estimations. Individuals are best accounted for by real people in their real lives. But that doesn't always happen. Earlier this year Janet Veal passed away in her apartment in Ringwood, Hampshire. Large portions of her body were eaten by her pet cats before she was discovered weeks later. And seven years ago Joyce Carol Vincent was found dead on her sofa, in Wood Green; or at least her skeleton was found. She'd been dead for at least three years and no one ever checked on her. Her television was still on. And four days after Timothy McVeigh bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City, taking 168 lives, a severed left leg was found in the rubble. No one knew who it belonged to. The legs of all the other victims had been accounted for and no one else had been reported missing. DNA analysis showed that the leg belonged to a Lakesha Levy, but she had already been buried with both her legs. So, they dug up her corpse. She'd been buried with someone else's left leg. The legs were swapped,  but because her body had been embalmed, DNA in the unknown leg could not be analyzed. To this day no one knows who that leg belongs to. The 169th victim remains a mystery. Some conspiracy theorists argue that the leg may have belonged to be actual bomber, someone besides Timothy McVeigh, who was close enough to the explosion to be obliterated completely, except for one leg. Regardless, what it does show is that it is possible for a person to disappear without anyone ever asking where they went. Sometimes people are reported dead or missing even when they aren't. Premature obituaries are common. Many living people already have one on file. If a famous person dies,  the media, television, newspapers, magazines, well they need a full story as soon as possible. So, they prepare them ahead of time, locked away, leaving only the dates and circumstances of the death to be filled in. Makes sense, but it's awkward when they leak before the person's dead. In 2003 CNN's website accidentally carried draft obituaries for living people that could be accessed. It's embarrassing, but for the person reading their own obituary, it's a chance to do something that most of us never get a chance to do. See how you will be remembered after you're gone. Alfred Nobel invented dynamite. He made a fortune manufacturing and selling deadly weapons - cannons and armaments. In 1888 his brother Ludvig died but many newspapers mistakenly thought that he had died and published obituaries for Alfred Nobel. They weren't very flattering. One French paper declared  ""The merchant of death is dead."" Nobel read these obituaries and was so ashamed by what his legacy apparently was going to be. When he did die, he left almost all of his money to the cause of celebrating humanity. He created The Nobel Prize. Marcus Garvey wasn't so lucky. The story goes that after suffering a stroke newspapers ran premature obituaries that were critical of him, saying, he died broke, alone and unpopular. Shocked by how negatively he was being remembered Garvey suffered another stroke while reading his own obituary and died. In April of 2006 five Taylor University students died in a tragic car accident. Another student survived, but was in a coma. She was identified as Laura van Ryn. Her friend Whitney Cerak wasn't as lucky. She was pronounced dead. A thousand people attended her funeral but over the next few days as Laura recovered, she began speaking and when asked her name, Laura said my name is Whitney. The girls looked similar. It turned out Laura was the one they had buried. Later, Whitney was married in the very same church that years before had held her funeral. What if you are already missing and just don't know it? It's not known how often hospitals accidentally switch babies at birth. Modern hospital policies make it unlikely to happen, but because we don't all go out and get maternity and paternity tests for fun, there isn't a lot of data on the phenomenon. But it does happen. It's often discovered because of DNA tests administered to resolve child support disputes. Or, in the case of the 35-year-old woman, in the Canary Islands, it's because in 2001 an employee at a store you're shopping at mistakes you for her best friend - because you look exactly like her, because she is your long-lost twin, separated from you since birth. And the sister you grew up with, thinking was your twin, turns out to be a biological stranger. What if you are missing but the authorities don't know? Such is the life of the unreported missing. People in a country illegally, people estranged from their family and friends with no missing person report ever being filed, children of homeless mothers. These people aren't just missing, they are what is known as missing missing. The FBI's National Crime Information Database contains approximately 50,000 reported missing children, but Outpost For Hope reports that there are more than a million children in America who are missing, without anyone knowing they're missing. It is not against the law to go missing under your own volition. You might have debts to pay or contracts to honor, but if you are an adult, the act of disappearing is not illegal in and of itself. You have the right to go missing. But believing that no one would miss you? That is ridiculous and unscientific. Statistics would suggest otherwise. David Wong wrote one of the most powerful articles I've ever read. There is a lot of information out there. There's even a word for it - infobesity. It takes a lifetime to even experience some of it. It's easy to think  that everyone knows everything that you know. But every year more than 100 million new people are born and not a single one of them is born knowing that they are made out of atoms  or that black holes are awesome. Someone needs to be there to tell them, to show them. How many jokes do you hear every day, every week? How many jokes do you hear every year? Here's a fun thought. By considering average life expectancy and the typical number of jokes a person hears in a year, David Wong posited a thought, rough in its approximation, but sharp in its essence. If you are under the age of 38 odds are the funniest joke you will ever hear is a joke you haven't even heard yet. And, if you are over the age of 38, odds are you already know a joke that to more people than you could ever possibly meet might be the funniest joke they will ever hear. So, wherever you are, we're glad you there. And as always, thanks for watching."
