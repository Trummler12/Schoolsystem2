"Where is the darkest part of a shadow? I mean the obvious answer seems to be, right in the middle. If you look closely at a shadow, as you move the object away from the wall, you notice that the shadow gets a bit fuzzy. So clearly, the edges are lighter. Now, we know that light bends around corners, that's a phenomenon call ""diffraction"". So, is it diffraction that's responsible for the fuzzy edges of shadows? Actually?... No. The reason that shadows have fuzzy edges, is because most light sources like the sun are not perfectly point objects. So, light from one edge of the sun is coming at a very slightly different angle from light from the other edge of the sun, and that's what gives us these fuzzy edges. It's not diffraction. But diffraction can play a significant role in shadows, and in fact, it was the cause of a massive debate, about 200 years ago... In 1818, the French Academy sponsored a competition to try to find the best explanation of diffraction. And Augustine Fresnel entered this competition with the suggestion that light is a wave phenomenon. And just like any ordinary wave, it bends as it passes around an obstacle. But one of the judges was Simeon Poisson, a harsh critic of the wave theory. He much preferred Newton's idea that light was a stream of particles. And to show just how ridiculous the wave theory was, He showed that Fresnel's theory would predict a bright spot in the shadow, right in the middle of the shadow behind a circular object. That there would be a spot, almost as bright as if the object wasn't there at all. And he thought this was absurd. But my question is, Does it exist? Is the brightest part of a shadow really in the middle? To find out, we're gonna have to do the experiment. So first I had to find some circular obstacles. I selected spheres instead. I got some marbles and some small spherical magnets. Then for a powerful light source and a large distance to the screen, I selected a lecture theater with a projector. Now the first thing we're gonna need is a small aperture for the light to pass through. So I'm gonna poke a hole in this card with a screw. It's important to have a small aperture because you want the light to be in phase. And that should work if it's all coming out of this small little aperture. But when I put a sphere in front of it ... Alright, somebody hit the lights. Here we go... I can't see a bright spot. I can't really see anything. So next I tried a cellphone flashlight, putting a marble in front of that And again I could see nothing. I don't see anything in the middle. The idea with Poisson's spot is that light should diffract around a circular object, or a sphere, And because the center of the shadow is equidistant from all the edges of that obstacle, all of the light should constructively interfere at that point creating that bright spot. So next I tried an overhead projector. I tried a string of the small spherical magnets. It's weird. Like, I feel like I can see it. Derek: Do you think you can see a bright spot in the middle of that bottom one?       Girl: No. Derek: No? I feel like in the very center of each one, I can see a bright spot. I don't know. My eyes are just totally going nuts up here. Like, staring at shadows and trying to see what we want. But this one is opaque. It's nice and speherical. Set it down... And if I adjust the focus... You can see there's a bright spot right in the middle of that marble. So the spot looks pretty good, but something about it didn't sit right with me. And you know, when you think something is true, you really should try as hard as you can to disprove it. What if you used your fingers to kind of  make the edges less spherical? Yeah You see now that, that I think is concerning, that fact we can still see a bit of spot even though it looks like you're... Right? How is the light getting through and getting there? What was really happening, was light was coming up from from the base of this overhead projector, bouncing off this lens, back onto the top of the marble, and then back up through this lens, and onto the wall. So finally I decided to use a laser I resisted doing this earlier because in 1818 they didn't have lasers. In fact, Poisson didn't do the experiment. He didn't think that you needed to. The idea of a bright spot in the middle of a shadow was just so ridiculous. And Fresnel didn't do the experiment either. But one of the other judges by the name of Arago decided to actually do the experiment. And when he did it, he saw something similar to what I saw. So here I was using the laser through a diverging lens. And then that beam was shone onto a marble resting on top of a loop of tape. So you can see on the wall, basically exactly what you'd expect. Just a shadow of the marble But when you turn the lights off... there it is... A bright spot right in the middle of that shadow. So the brightest part of a shadow is, in the middle! As long as it's the shadow of a circular or spherical object. Now this spot is sometimes called Arago's spot because he did the experiment and found it. Sometime's it's called Fresnel's birght spot because it was his theory. But pretty frequently, it's referred to as Poisson's spot. A harsh reminder that it's not only your great achievements, but also your greatest mistakes that can be named after you. We don't see Poisson's spot in our day-to-day lives for many reasons, one of which is that most objects are not prefect circles. Plus if they have any surface roughness, really any at all, that will completely wash out Poisson's spot. And finally, most light sources are not coherent. That is, the waves are not coming all in phase: peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs. You might think you could never see Poisson's spot under ordinary conditions. But you can... What you need to do is look at a diffuse source of bright light like a fluorescent tube or the blue sky. You should see some small light specks drifting around your visual field. Now those are caused by floaters. Little particles actually drifting around inside your eyeball. And they can be all sorts of different shapes, but some of them are spheres. And so they cast a shadow on the back of your retina. And right in the middle of that shadow is Poisson's bright spot. And that is what demonstrated that light really is a wave phenomenon. And you don't even have to take my word for it. You can see it with your very own eyes."

"Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Steve Seitz and Chuck Dyer used view morphing to  digitally reveal a side of the Mona Lisa we've never seen before. What it would look like if she stared directly at us. That's her but it seems a bit unfamiliar. I mean, there is only one iconic view of the Mona Lisa. There's only one physical object you can look at to say that you saw the Mona Lisa with your own eyes. Photographs exist. There are copies you can also look at. There are forgeries, there are parodies but the true original Mona Lisa is in the Louvre. That's where it is. But where is this video? Seriously, where is this video? I mean, it's on your screen right now but it's also on a lot of other screens. Where's the original? Well, it's stored on YouTube servers and the original export is on my hard drive but those are just instructions for making the video. This video is anywhere. Every stream, every viewing of this video is, as Bill Thompson would say, ""a digital simulacrum of something that has no original"". So, how does a museum curator  or an archaeologist deal with this? Well, they are rethinking curating. I mean, take a look at this sculpture. ""The distance from this sentence to your eye is my sculpture."" That's pretty cool, but how do you put something like that in a museum? This sculpture and this video can be endlessly copied and every version is made out of different stuff at different times, a bit like your body. There's an identity crisis going on. As I discussed before, every few years nearly all of your atoms are replaced. Old ones leave, new ones come in. Where is the original you? Like this video, you are really just the result of a set of instructions being followed. And in our cases, interestingly,  those instructions are kind of forgeries. 'The $12 Million Stuffed Shark' is a great book about the art world. It mentions that, at one point in history, there were 600 Rembrandt's hanging in museums and 350 Rembrandt's in private collections. The only problem is Rembrandt scholars say that Rembrandt only ever made 320 paintings. Mistaken identity, forgeries and phonies have been around for a long time. In 1496 a young Michelangelo, the same Michelangelo that painted this, forged a statue. He treated the statue with acid to make it look not like his own work but like the work of ancient Greeks or Romans, so he could sell it for more money. But really, what's wrong with a forgery? I mean, sure, supporting forgeries is like supporting plagiarism but as far as intrinsic aesthetic properties go, what's the difference? Whether painted by Da Vinci, or a dog, or copied perfectly by a robot, wouldn't the Mona Lisa smile just as mysteriously and cooly? Well, here's the thing. We feel like the original, the Mona Lisa Da Vinci originally made, has an aura about it. As Richard Wiseman discussed in Quirkology - a great book - psychologist Paul Rosen once studied just how obsessed we are with relics, things important merely because of their auras. He found that people were more willing to wear a sweater that had been dropped in dog poop than they were to wear a sweater they had been told what was once owned by a mass murderer. We are influenced by auras. Right now, I am in Mougin. The city in southeastern France where Picasso died. On one occasion Picasso refused to sign a painting he knew he had painted, saying ""I can paint a fake Picasso just like anybody else."" You can disown your own paintings and you can disown your children but you can claim to have created your own paintings, but can you really claim to have created your own children? Let's explore a metaphor. Your mother is a 3D printer that printed you. But hold on, your parents conceived you and curated you, cared for you. But the actual blueprints that made you were outside of their conscious control. Your blueprint is a forgery. It has been copied, replicated, over and over again, ever since the very first group of molecules were arranged in a way that automatically replicated billions and billions of years ago. It's not a perfect forgery. Changes occur every time, making successive copies a little bit different. But 99.9 percent of your DNA isn't different from anyone else's. Now, you might say, but wait, Michael, we all look so different. Kind of. But that's also because your brain is particularly good at recognizing differences amongst things that you are familiar with. It's called the cross-race effect and it's the reason new twins you've never met before look totally the same, until you get used to them. It's the reason people from a culture you're not use to tend to be more difficult to distinguish. And the reason, say, a big group of black labs you've never met before all kind of look like the same black lab. We all have a common descendant, a common person our DNA has been replicated from over and over again, making us, in a funny way, a big bunch of forgeries. Go back 50 forgeries ago, 50 generations ago, and that's enough to connect every single human living on Earth. I've said this before, you are at least 50th cousins with everyone else living on the planet today. But we can go back further than that, as Guy Murchie famously did. You see, animal populations, and even molecule populations, experience replication variation and selective pressures, which means you are trillionth cousins with all life on Earth and, technically speaking, quadrillionth cousins with water and trees and rocks. It's a beautiful notion but it's anything but new. The word 'human' comes from a word for soil. And compare the Hebrew word for 'ground' with their name for the first man. You are quadrillionth cousins with dirt, with rocks, with trees, with plastic, with the very clothing you are wearing right now. So whether you're fighting with a stranger in a bar or stubbing your toe on a rock, it's all just a family squabble. And as always, thanks for watching. Oh, hey, you're still there. This is great because I have some really cool news. Vsauce was just nominated for a Webby, in the news and information category. It's a really big honor and I want to thank you guys for making this possible. You can be a Vsaucer in a whole new way now by voting for Vsauce in the Webby's.

"so one of the questions a lot of us have been asking since the launch of james webb telescope is how exactly is it going to handle the collisions with various micrometeorites especially because it's going to be staying in space without any ability to repair this telescope for several years and very likely up to several decades or at least one decade in other words the question is what happens when one of the micrometeorites strikes the mirrors or hits some other essential part of the telescope is the mission going to be over well obviously the answer to that question is no but there is a more specific answer to this that we're going to be talking about in this video because as you might have heard already it just happened a slightly larger than average micrometeorite officially hit one of the main mirrors on the telescope but what you might have not heard yet is that this is not the first time it happened since the launch this is actually the fifth time it happened and the first four collisions were not really that major and so in this video i wanted to talk a little bit more about the details behind what happened what all of this means and more importantly what we know about these micro collisions or micrometeorite collisions from the previous import missions such as hubble which as you can probably imagine received so many more collisions over the period of about 30 years and this is exactly where we're going to start the iconic hubble telescope the telescope that changed everything and you might already be aware that in the beginning when the hubble just started operating nasa performed several so-called hubble servicing missions in order to replace some of the parts on the telescope that were either aging or were outdated or maybe even broken and as they were doing so they actually ended up bringing some of the parts back to planet earth to be studied in more detail and even in the first few years of its existence when the space around the planet was not really that crowded yet hubble has already accumulated quite a lot of different impact craters from various collisions so for example in 1993 approximately three years after the original launch these solar panels here had to be replaced because of the unusual temperature fluctuation they were causing to the telescope and the fun fact is that the solar panels were the contribution from the european space agency and were actually then returned to the esa for further study once they were retrieved from the hubble telescope and this was actually the first opportunity in history of space exploration to see the kind of impacts that would occur on any spacecraft after about two years orbiting planet earth and here they found hundreds of impact craters on just a small section of the solar array some of them were extremely tiny only microns in size but some of them were relatively large approximately several millimeters then nine years later solar panels were replaced yet again returned to planet earth and once again even more impact craters were found here as well this particular solar panel is actually on the display in the netherlands inside the esa's technology center known as aztec but in this case the scientists also wanted to find out where exactly the impact craters came from was it from micrometeorites was it from some kind of a human-made debris or was it from something else entirely in other words they also decided to conduct a chemical analysis on every single one of these collisions and they did so by looking at whatever was unusual present inside the impact craters that should not have been there and that probably came from something else and so for a lot of these impact craters the fragments inside were from micrometeorites it was because of things like iron and nickel but some of them also contained aluminum and oxygen which very likely came from human activity essentially from various solid rocket motors or from various space debris and considering the amount of debris that's orbiting the planet it should not really come as a surprise and here the team even went as far as matching the shape and size of various craters to actual models of rockets that were responsible for producing the debris but obviously even after 30 years of the collisions here the hubble telescope is still operating and still producing all the imagery we have today in other words the scientists have definitively established that these collisions these micrometeorites even though they do cause occasional problems are not going to be causing any major faults in a telescope or are going to be the reason for the emission failure although they do cause a kind of a gradual degradation in the amount of power the solar panels can provide and also the gradual declination in the quality of images but in this case some of this can be actually restored with software although interestingly enough in the last decade or so the amount of debris has obviously increased dramatically and the chance for a collision has gone from approximately 0.15 chance per year to approximately 0.3 per day increasing by about 700 times okay but that's collisions on the hubble telescope what about james webb i mean we know that the solar panels should be okay over time but how about the other parts the shield or the telescope mirrors which in this case are directly exposed to open space well first of all we have to remember that because this particular telescope is not orbiting the planet but it's actually in the lagrange 2 point it's pretty far away from any human-made debris and because of this the chance of a collision here is pretty low overall on top of this in this region it's also not going to be receiving a lot of micrometeorites which usually tend to approach planet earth simply because it's the largest gravitational body in this area but more importantly these mirrors were specifically designed to withstand impacts from soundly smaller micrometeoroids although over time it's very likely that the appearance of these mirrors is going to become a little bit more rough reducing in the overall reflectivity and also becoming a little bit more rugged as well but for the first few years all these imperfections can be easily corrected digitally and also because when the mirrors were originally designed they were created to be even smoother than they should have been in other words the actual telescope does not have to be as perfect as it currently is it can still operate even if the mirrors are slightly scratched and so today the models suggest that it will probably take at least a few years before any of this becomes a significant problem and since the original launch a few months ago there have already been force more measurable micrometeoroid strikes with all of them directly meeting the expectations and the mathematical models however the most recent fifth collision was a little bit larger than the predictions and the original assumptions and so because of this the scientists behind the mission have to crunch a few numbers and develop future techniques for when this happens again at the moment though this is definitely not a problem and is not going to cause any issues for future observations and so in this case the mission is still a go and it's still going to be performing way beyond our expectations and the recent measurements just from a few days ago suggested that all the components on the telescope are still performing way beyond expectations and technically even exceed the original expectations the scientists had for this mission and since the telescope has already been in space for i guess half a year receiving only five collisions is actually good news it means that maybe this will be a lot less common than the scientists thought there's actually a really good article by nasa that you can find in the description below it sort of goes through very common questions about the resiliency of this telescope and how likely the mirrors are to survive a lot of different types of collisions from various micrometeorites with the scientists here even explaining different techniques that were used to test the mirrors and how everything on a telescope was engineered to withstand a lot of different types of damage and a lot of bombardment from various objects and one of the ways that all this will be done in the future when there's a lot of damage on the telescope is going to be by adjusting the position of certain segments and thus canceling out the portion of distortions coming from the damaged parts in other words there is a physical way in which the scientists are going to be able to try to counteract the damage to certain mirrors and this has already been done for the recently damaged segment known as c3 and when it comes to more dramatic events such as meteor showers the team in this case can also prevent the further damage by conducting certain protective maneuvers so for example by turning the optics away from known meteor showers before they occur although the most recent collision was not from a meteor shower it was one of those events that just happens by chance and one of the other things that the scientists are hoping to learn from all of this is actually in regards to these collisions by keeping the james webb telescope in this position for several years it sort of turns the telescope into a kind of a highly sensitive detector of various micrometeorites which can also help us learn a little bit more about the micrometeorite condition in these environments and also teach us a little bit more about the collisions as we become interplanetary species and as we start launching missions to for example mars and so it will definitely help the scientists measure the overall effect of micrometeorite collisions for various other objects and various other telescopes especially in the region known as the lagrange two points something that has never really been measured before by previous missions and so at least for now that's kind of all we know we know that the james webb seems to be operating normally we know that it's going to be releasing its first images on july 12th and we also know that the mission seems to be a go and nothing seems to be broken and will probably stay normal for many years to come in this case the entire telescope was definitely engineered and designed to withstand a lot of different damage but once more news comes out on once we'll learn something else i'll make sure to fold this up in another video until then thank you for watching subscribe maybe share this video with someone who loves learning about space and sciences and maybe come back tomorrow to learn something else

"about three years ago i made a lot of videos about this one phenomenon that back in 2019 gripped the world the phenomenon in regards to the star known as beetlejuice middle juice pirogeus say it three times and he appears behind you wait that's from another movie anyway you might already remember the story but back then the scientists were not sure what's actually happening to this iconic star one of the brightest stars in the night skies for some reason it started to dim with its overall brightness dropping by quite a large amount as a matter of fact the change was quite visible in a nice case if you knew where to look but then within a year by february of 2020 it stopped demon and started to brighten yet again and ever since then for approximately two years it more or less remained the same with some of the more recent observations using other frequencies such as infrared white determining that not much has actually changed around the star suggesting that it wasn't really going through some major changes on the inside and more importantly suggesting that it's definitely not going to go supernova as suggested by some of the media sources this was not going to happen for at least 10 000 years or possibly even longer and following several major observations in various frequencies and very thorough investigations by some of the best scientists around the planet it was more or less confirmed that what was happening to middle juice was very likely a result of a mid-remission from the surface that ended up creating a relatively large dust cloud with the dust cloud when released from the surface essentially blocking the star in just the right way which resulted in the overall demon effect and this is pretty much the explanation that everyone accepted it kind of made sense it also was supported by evidence from various telescopes and because beetlejuice has now been acting relatively normally there was absolutely no reason to suspect that it's going to go supernova or do anything else extremely unusual but there was still one question what exactly was this event what happened to beetlejuice three years ago to make this happen and i guess more importantly is it going to happen again can it happen again and that's exactly what the recent article from nasa tries to explore and it's actually by the relatively famous scientist who was actually the first to ever image the surface of this particular star using hubble telescope back in 1996. back then they were able to produce these beautiful images you see right here and were even able to resolve the first ever hot spots on the surface of another star other than our own sun and so the same scientists wanted to see what actually happened here and wanted to once again use hubble to investigate this and to try to resolve the mystery once and for all although in this case they didn't just use hubble they used several different observatories for example stellar robotic observatory in spain one of the telescopes in harvard and even one of the telescopes that's currently orbiting the sun known as stereo although in this case the data from the hubble telescope was actually the most beneficial and the one that was able to help us resolve this and well first of all and i guess that's the more important confirmation this star is not going to go supernova anytime soon the amount of mass lost from the star is completely insignificant compared to what we expect from a star that's about to go supernova but when compared to some of the more earthly terms the mass loss was actually pretty huge now in terms of the actual mass middle juice is at least 16 times the mass of our own sun it's also as you can see from this image not particularly spherical that's very common with these giant stars as a matter of fact there was a study not so long ago just a few months ago that sort of established that for these really really large stars it's generally relatively difficult to establish where their center is normally in astronomy to determine the center of the star the scientists will usually look for the center of brightness but for a typical red giant starlight beetlejuice the actual center of brightness the center of maximum luminosity tends to jump around or basically dance around and it actually kind of moves around everywhere it looks like this and so determining where the actual star is located and thus determining its distance becomes kind of problematic which basically suggests that these stars are just extremely active they're very unpredictable they're not particularly permanent in terms of shape and in terms of the actual activity on the surface and they're very dynamic they change all the time which is why here it does not look like a sphere and sort of resembles an unusual blob a blob that's not particularly dense either it's almost like some kind of a very large cloud of plasma rather than the actual star-like object but because this was such a bright star and a very well studied star and also a star with very predictable 400 day long pulsations that have been studied for nearly 300 years when suddenly the star experienced an unusual dimming effect and the pulsations also disappeared this definitely created one of the biggest mysteries in 2019 and is still technically the bigger mystery today as well beetlejuice by the way is somewhere right there is the orange that you see with this here showing us the iconic orion's belt and the orion nebula that you can see surrounding the belt and so the scientists behind this recent study really wanted to find out where did the pulsations go are they going to come back and what caused the unusual demon effect with all the observations in this case once again suggesting that the star lost a huge part of its visible surface resulting in the production what the scientists now call surface mass ejection or sme for short and obviously this is a type of behavior that's never been seen anywhere else before to some extent i guess it's comparable to the coronal mass ejections cmes around our own sun and that's of course when our sun does something like this throwing off a huge amount of mass from its surface but when comparing the numbers what happened around betelgeuse was about 400 billion times larger in terms of mass equivalent in mass to several times the mass of the moon and that's completely unimaginable by current standards that's something scientists believe that the stars could not actually do but looks like they can and when this chunk there was several masses of the moon in size left the surface of the star it very likely fractured a huge part of the photosphere of the star with the gas then cooling down to form a dust cloud that essentially blocked the light from the star as seen from planet earth with the dimming effects lasting for just a few months and this particular event the first such observed ever has also dramatically affected the star with beetlejuice still recovering from all of this even now for example various convection cells that are present inside the star which normally drive the pulsation and the circulation of material might have been disrupted by this event and are still sloshing around uncontrollably unable to produce regular pulsations that's of course why the regular pulsations are no longer visible and although the telescope observations suggest that the outer layers could already be back to normal the surface itself is still quite disturbed and is still bouncing around creating a lot of chaotic behavior and so it will probably take some time before the photosphere can reveal itself and before the star can return to be normal and i guess more importantly it also suggests that this is definitely not the same mechanism as the coronal message action it very likely has nothing to do with magnetic lines or magnetic fields and very likely was produced by something entirely different currently it's believed to be an entirely new phenomenon but the scientists now believe that it could have been caused by some kind of a convection plume several million miles or kilometers across that bubbled inside the star and produced this unusual expulsion of material or in other words it was some kind of a star bubble millions of kilometers in size but i guess more importantly this event shows us how these huge stars generally lose their mass and how they prepare themselves for the eventual supernova afterwards but how long the recovery stage is going to take before beetlejuice returns back to normal that's not the question we have the answer to but we might have an answer if the scientists are able to observe this in the infrared light by for example using jim's web telescope or by conducting additional observations in other frequencies as well because the dust here is only visible in the infrared light this might actually help the scientists see some of the previous eruptions if they ever happened and it might also help the scientists track where this gas is going and how this gas might evolve the nebula around it or maybe even determine how long video juice actually has before it explodes at the moment though because this is still an entirely new phenomenon and it's never been seen before around any other star out there all this is basically news to us still an exciting new observation and definitely a really important one because the evolution of these red stars is crucial to the evolution of the rest of the galaxy and since beetlejuice is such an iconic star anything that happens around it is also extremely intriguing and extremely important but i guess until we'll learn something else or until new discoveries that's pretty much all i wanted to mention we'll definitely talk more about beetlejuice and other red giants in some of the future videos for now though that's pretty much it check out all the relevant links in the

largest particle collider on the planet the cern collider and here you can kind of explore what all this looks like from the perspective of an engineer or scientist working here or you can kind of zoom in exploring the city itself admiring the entire infrastructure that was created in order to make this particular project operational hello info person this is anton and today we're going to be answering a question that i often get asked on the channel and didn't really get to answer before the question being why is it that we haven't really been able to create any black holes here on planet earth could a particle collider produce a black hole and would such a black hole be dangerous in any way to our planet something that appeared as a major concern for the last couple of decades ever since cern became operational with this article by nasa being particularly intriguing because of the title the day the world didn't end and all this was because of several articles written in various magazines back in the days that suggested that maybe in theory these particle colliders could actually produce some kind of a black hole that could maybe absorb everything on the planet and destroy planet earth but could any of this happen could these black holes be produced in the collider and could they actually destroy anything well if you're about to click away from this video the answer to all these questions is no but let me explain to you in more detail so one of these concerns was actually because of how powerful cern has become it's currently able to collide different types of subatomic particles at ridiculously high velocities with extremely high energies and in the last few years as the scientists installed more and more upgrades on this particle accelerator they were able to beat previous records achieving higher and higher energies which in essence allows them to create a lot of other subatomic particles or exotic particles that could have been predicted by some studies or could have never been thought of before and that's of course how the confirmation of the higgs boson came to be as well the existence of a subatomic particle that was very hypothetical until it was discovered approximately a decade ago but every few years the higher and higher energies are achieved and new records are established which at least in theory could allow the scientists doing all this discover new unusual subatomic particles new phenomena or potentially even new physics something we've discussed in one of the previous videos from a few months ago that should be in the description but early on specifically in the first few years there was a bit of a concern in regards to what could be created by these collisions could the scientists accidentally create something we don't really want to create on planet earth for example could you somehow merge particles in order to create something extremely dense something resembling a black hole a black hole that starts small but eventually absorbs the entire planet and everything around it as well and that's why science communication as a field and as a profession is super important because very often people misunderstand certain concepts and very often associate certain words or certain principles with something that is not actually true in this case black holes many people today imagine a black hole as a kind of a vacuum cleaner with unlimited power something that is super super powerful and something that essentially sucks up all the matter around it and something that even though it could start small would eventually absorb everything around it and expand creating something even larger than before but that's not actually what we believe black holes to be and we don't actually think they do that at all for example in theory you could turn anything into a black hole you could take an apple or you can actually take yourself and condense yourself into very very dense mass that would then become a black hole but in order for an apple or in this case you to become a black hole it would actually have to be ridiculously small even smaller than any subatomic particle for example you can use this calculator that you can find in a description to try to calculate how big of a black hole you would become based on your mass in this case an average adult would actually be a black hole of 10 to the power of minus 17 nanometers and that's super super super small once again that's more than most subatomic particles on top of this we know that black holes generally evaporate and that's based on the hawking radiation principle something that was proposed by iconic stephen hawking a few decades ago and according to this calculator the lifetime of this black hole would be 1 times 10 to the power of minus 11 seconds a tiny tiny fraction of a second before this black hole completely disappears becoming just energy and a black hole that's so small and the black hole that only exists for such a short period of time would not have time to do anything to anything around it it would not be able to absorb any matter it would not be able to do anything to any of the atoms or particles around it and it would just disappear and nobody would know it even existed but that's a black hole that's mass of a person in this case the amount of material used in these studies is minuscule and so the size of this black hole decreases dramatically and so does the total lifetime of this black hole if ever such a black hole was created it would actually exist for less than the universe allows the minimum time frame we have is called planck time in this case it seems to be below that limit in other words in terms of the modern understanding of how we think the universe works it would not actually allow for this black hole to even exist or if it did exist it would probably break some laws of physics somewhere but also because black holes don't work like vacuum cleaners but actually work more like typical objects with typical mass in this case it's all about gravity so even an object that for example is your mass or let's just say just an average adult would not actually exert that much gravity on anything around it in order to absorb more mass or to add more mass to itself because the only way a black hole can increase in mass is if it actually starts adding more mass to itself through some sort of a collision but because of the tiny size of this particular black hole it would simply be incapable of touching anything or reaching anything its gravity is also very low so it's not going to be attracting anything either so even if a black hole was somehow created in some kind of a particle collider it would just be insignificant it would disappear without anyone ever knowing and that's actually why it's almost impossible to currently answer the question of whether these black holes have ever been made on planet earth even if they were created they disappeared before anyone noticed but also the question is could it be created well the answer to that is probably also no even though the collision energy between these particles is really high it's still relatively low as a matter of fact some of the natural particle accelerators such as various black holes various very powerful explosions somewhere out there in the universe produce particles with energy hundreds of millions of times higher than anything we can create here on planet earth and even natural particle accelerators in the magnetosphere of our planet created by the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar radiation creates something that's more powerful than we create in cern and so if black holes could be created anywhere they are more likely to be created around our planet not on it but even here we don't think it's happening at all and if it has ever been created on our planet or above our planet well there would be signs of this somewhere possibly signs of large explosions so large parts of matter missing or something as a matter of fact there was an article i discussed last year that briefly talked about the hypothetical scenario where costs could be colliding with our moon and there should be a way for us to detect them by using modern calculations of various craters so far nothing but still possible but if by some chance cern does create a black hole based on current calculations of the total mass used it would only be approximately 5 times 10 to the power of minus 20 grams once again creating a black code that's just impossible both in terms of the time data would exist and even in terms of the total size it's actually below the allowed total length it's lower than one plank length the small size the universe currently allows according to this calculator here is the smallest amount of material needed for black hole to actually exist in terms of the length and in this case is going to exist for a tiny tiny tiny fraction of the time it's equivalent to about 11 micrograms or the amount of material you sometimes find written on for example a vitamin pill bottle and that's way more material and way more total mass than the scientists actually use inside these particle accelerators because of the amount of energy required the total mass here is much much much much lower and as you can see from this calculation the total size of this black hole is also minuscule so there's absolutely no way it can ever affect anything around it now it might still be affected by gravity of planet earth but even as it travels through our planet it's unlikely to touch anything or unlikely to interact with any of the particles either but even if it did absorb some of the particles as it moved to the planet it would still only absorb several thousand different particles increasing its mass by just a tiny fraction in other words it would not turn into this super massive black hole that would destroy everything and if it keeps absorbing more and more mass as it travels through the planet it would actually take it a pretty long time before it becomes anything significant in order for this black hole to become large enough to finally affect anything around it you would probably need trillions and trillions of years of traveling through the planet and constantly absorbing mass but because of the hawking radiation it's most likely going to evaporate faster then it's going to have a chance to absorb something else and so in order to create a stable black hole that's going to exist long enough for it to start absorbing mass from the planet and to possibly even grow large and larger in size you would need to have an initial mass of at least several billion tons because without this mass is going to become unstable and then evaporate but if there is a black code that's several billion tons in mass in that case it can actually start absorbing mass around it and grow larger and larger something that the scientists think might exist out there something we refer to as primordial black hose and something the scientists have used to explain the hypothetical dark matter that might exist in the universe at the moment all this is still hypothetical and none of this is certainly known and since none of the particle accelerators on the planet can accelerate so much mass all at once creating anything similar to this and we don't actually have to worry about some kind of a black hole destroying planet earth at worst even if the black hole is created it's going to disappear before anyone can even notice but at best there's just not enough mass for the universe to even allow for this black hole to exist we can create other particles subatomic particles but we cannot create a black hole that's going to exist because either its total size or its total time of existence is beyond the plank length or the planck time the minimal length and the minimal time allowed by the universe itself and so that's why cern or other particle accelerators did not end the planet when they started operating but they did discover a lot of intriguing things and potentially even things violating modern physics at least modern understanding of physics and that's something i've discussed in one of the previous videos you can find on the channel or somewhere right there or also in the description below there's also this other video about the potential formation of neutron matter on the planet that you might want to take a look at as well it's somewhat different from what we've talked about today but it's related to the unusual exotic particles that the scientists are trying to create on the planet something that was also created in the particle accelerator but anyway on that note hopefully this answers your question so don't worry about black holes on planet earth probably not going to happen on that note thank you for watching subscribe maybe share this with someone who loves learning about space and sciences

"so here I was doing a little bit of research on planet 9 and trying to find out if there are possibly other solar systems that have a somewhat similar structure with a relatively large planet on the outskirts of the main solar system and to my surprise I've discovered an article about a planet that is ridiculously large and ridiculously far away from its um primary star and that particular solar system is apparently the biggest solar system in our galaxy welcome to what the maath and let's talk about this solar [Music] system and to my surprise I was also able to find uh that system in space engine which we'll be using near the end of the video where we're going to explore that particular uh system in more detail but let's actually do this in Universe Sandbox first we're going to go into the normal solar system here and I'm going to show you how big that solar system is now it has a funny name its name is Tass J 2126 8140 unfortunately though this system or its star or its um Planet are not in uh Universe Sandbox it hasn't been added to um their catalog yet because it ends at 21 uh 1 and doesn't have 212 so that's okay we're going to create a manual um version of this particular system using our own Sun so here is Sun here's Earth this is one astronomical unit and let me just show you how large this system would be and essentially what they've discovered is so there's a central star uh very similar to our sun and relatively far away from it I'm going to have to use edit here uh at a distance of on average about 4500 astronomical units which is close to 5,000 times more than um the distance from our sun to our planet Earth there is a very very large gas giant and look at how much I have to zoom out here first there we go just place it around 5,000 astronomical units uh there's another star here and this star uh sorry not star there's another planet here and this planet is called two Mass J 2126 8140 and this is kind of what it looks like in the game so it's sort of um a gas giant that's about to become a brown dwarf that may one day uh or would have one day become a star if he had more mass but it just didn't have enough mass and so it stayed as a very very hot gas giant and when it was originally found um it actually had a different name as a matter of fact the scientists thought that this was a brown dwarf it turns out that it's not um and uh when they've originally found it it was classified as a brown dwarf until they realized it was actually moving exactly in the same direction and in exactly the same way as its parent star and so they had to then rename this to um to basically give it a a planetary classification because they realized this was actually the the largest possible solar system that we've found so far and uh the radius right here is about 5,000 chmical units which is about 7% of one lightyear so it's it's pretty far uh not I guess not as far as as as a near star to us which is four light years four four and and point2 light years um but it it is pretty pretty far nevertheless and one orbit around this star would take this planet about um 1 million years so yeah I'm sorry I keep calling it star but it's not really a star it's actually it is a very large gas giant and and so the temperature of um of this particular planet is close to 2,000 de C it's about uh 10 to 15 times mass of Jupiter and if I were to place Jupiter next to it this is what it would look like so it's in terms of size it's not much bigger than Jupiter but it definitely is a lot more massive and um it definitely might even have a very large sort of um Moon system around it it um which is what we're going to be exploring in space engine uh near the end of the video and what's really interesting about this particular system is that now we actually realize that uh Stars can actually form in different ways not just in how we usually imagine them forming from one sort of a disc of spinning material where certain things become planets certain things become uh moons and then certain things become uh the star essentially but here the new proposition is that there was very likely have been sort of like a cloud of gas in this region and a cloud of gas in this region that sort of uh coales into a star with planets and a gas giant with its own Moon so they actually were almost like a binary system except this never became a star and they were relatively far away from each other so here what would happen um if a star if another star came into um sort of vicinity of the system um unfortunately this this planet would lose its orbit so I'm going to demonstrate this by just launching a random main sequence star through this area right here I just launch it somewhere I don't know just here and here we go so if if this actually passes by relatively close to them uh the orbit of two Mass J 2126 would actually be disturb enough for it to lose its um orbital path and there you go this you can see orbit already changing and then eventually just kind of Fly Away into the other door [Music] system and interestingly it actually got Disturbed at first and almost lost its orbit and then it reestablished it so I guess um there's still a chance that it it may have had some sort of a close encounter with other stars and didn't really Escape uh but what what's really important to understand here is that it may have been formed in a very um relatively empty environment so other stars couldn't disturb these two and that its orbit is relatively weak so if I were to do this again let's just do this for fun one more time we're going to launch another random main sequence star going somewhere here and it's going relatively fast I should probably slow down a little bit let's slow down to 500 kilm per second and here we go so it's passing it's going to pass relatively close to uh the planet here and it's very likely is going to disturb its orbit uh to the point where it might actually escape and so there you go um so yeah there's H quite a lot of really cool theories that might form as a result of uh this discovery uh mostly in in relation to how our solar systems are formed and look at that it's reestablished the orbit again it's been really stubborn which is pretty cool I guess anyway so um what I wanted to basically talk about is the idea of us really not knowing that much about um how some Stars may actually form we have a lot of um hypotheses we have a lot of speculations but um now that we've found this really interesting system that has a planet so so so so far away uh first of all it suggests that uh yes Planet 9 might be a reality because we don't really exactly know how some planets might might form um and the other thing is that uh so there's actually quite a lot of different ways for solar systems to form and let's actually go into space engine and explore this particular uh planet or I guess you could call it on almost brown dwarf because in space engine it has some really cool planets around it and so if you go to space engine and you start typing two mass and then basically uh what you I think you you have to type is 2126 uh you will find there's only one uh star that um meets this classification and it's this star right here go to it and that's essentially what uh that planet is that what I was talking about unfortunately since this is a little bit outdated here it's still classified as a brown DF which which is what it was up until 2016 and 2016 we've realized that this is actually not a brown dwarf this is just a very large gas giant uh the mass here is a little bit larger than it should be here it's 23 masses of Jupiter in reality it's about closer to about 10 to 15 um or something close to about 40% mass of sun so it's it's relatively large but uh nevertheless it's not really a brown dwarf it is an exoplanet uh or planet outside of solar system and this particular exoplanet in space engine has its own system of moons and some which are actually really awesome I've already explored this a little bit but we're going to go and um land on some of them just to check them out so this here is a cool Oceania or a cool ocean world that check it out it looks relatively scary actually because it's kind of red and uninviting but essentially imagine being on this world and landing on this Moon that has these really really sort of dark red skies at all times this is what it would look like in a sky if you were to kind of land here and this is essentially an ocean I think I think that's an ocean um but this planet is this moon is relatively cold it's- 24Â° C so any water here would be obviously Frozen and anything else um like for example methane or any other um material would not actually be liquid just yet so it might not actually have any any actual oceans on it even though it's called Oceania the second one here is a cool or coold desert which is also pretty funny name uh- 148Â° c a pretty cool um Northern or Southern Lights or Aurora brial whatever you want to call it there um and once again this is a pretty red World very beautiful red World kind of reminiscent of Mars in the sense and what I really like about some of these desert worlds is that if you actually come really close to them you'll get to see all of the awesome procedurally generated detail that this game is famous for so the closer you get the more detail you get look at that we get almost get to see the sand grains so here we are we've landed on this really cool desert World um and so a lot of these are actually pretty interesting to explore and I'm I really like how uh this particular uh planet or exoplanet actually is not actually technically exoplanet yet so it's considered to be a star but because of this it's it has these various planets generated around it now we don't actually have the companion star or the main star here um unfortunately this star is not in the catalog for this game um but hopefully the developer will add it at some point because this was a pretty big Discovery in early 2016 so I'm sure he's going to edit it for sure now there's a few more Frozen worlds here um they kind of look very similar to the one I just showed you and so most of them basically look like darker and colder marsus uh and this one actually has a pretty interesting pattern on it almost looks like a picture of a man um but what I wanted to see is if there is also gas giants because I haven't explored all of these and I think there is actually no uh not going to be any gas giants here yeah so this is actually a pretty interesting and pretty accurate representation of what um this particular ex planet might have orbiting around it so all of these would be moons and um there will be quite a lot of them would be quite large so imagine just like our Jupiter has at least four major moons that we call Galilean moons this one seems to have six of them and they're all very large they're relatively cold and they would be um possibly quite dark as well because the only light they would be getting is from um the uh um the exoplanet itself and it doesn't actually meit that much light uh here it's a little bit larger so it Maks a little bit more light but since it's not technically even a brown dwarf it only really emits um large amounts of um infrared light which would uh make these planets relatively warmer than they would be otherwise but it wouldn't give them a lot of visual light so they would still be quite dark not even as bright as you see them here all right so I think that's all I wanted to show you in this particular video and I hope you enjoyed it so we're going to land on this oania once again and check out actually fly through these um Northern Lights as well and check out its surface one more time and um if you enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe if you still haven't and don't forget to share this video with someone who you think may enjoy Space videos as well like it if you liked it and look at this beauty holy cow this is actually worthy of a screenshot um and uh if you actually want to check out more of the videos uh related to space engine or Universe sbox 2 do check them out in the link that you see on the screen or in the description below and what I just realized is actually if I wait a little bit longer on the surface of this planet you'll notice that there's actually new effect here specifically look at that there's clouds in the sky this is such a beautiful view so this is what this Oceania looks like this is something I didn't expect to see while making this video this is incredibly beautiful so there's a almost like a sunset I guess I guess it's Sunset not really sunrise and you get to see the ocean floor here and then we can even go underwater I think yeah we can go a little bit underwater so there is some sort of a liquid I just don't really know what it is um because here it says we have atmosphere of carbon dioxide sulfur oxide and nitrogen but I don't think it's either one of these but anyway so that's essentially what I wanted to show you in this beautiful ending of this video and once again if you'd like to support this channel even more there's always the patreon page where you can possibly support me a little bit more so that I can actually make this channel even better even more interesting and produce more high quality videos anyway thank you so much guys I really appreciate all of your support I'll see you in the next video game you later and as always bye-bye"

"Where is the darkest part of a shadow? I mean the obvious answer seems to be, right in the middle. If you look closely at a shadow, as you move the object away from the wall, you notice that the shadow gets a bit fuzzy. So clearly, the edges are lighter. Now, we know that light bends around corners, that's a phenomenon call ""diffraction"". So, is it diffraction that's responsible for the fuzzy edges of shadows? Actually?... No. The reason that shadows have fuzzy edges, is because most light sources like the sun are not perfectly point objects. So, light from one edge of the sun is coming at a very slightly different angle from light from the other edge of the sun, and that's what gives us these fuzzy edges. It's not diffraction. But diffraction can play a significant role in shadows, and in fact, it was the cause of a massive debate, about 200 years ago... In 1818, the French Academy sponsored a competition to try to find the best explanation of diffraction. And Augustine Fresnel entered this competition with the suggestion that light is a wave phenomenon. And just like any ordinary wave, it bends as it passes around an obstacle. But one of the judges was Simeon Poisson, a harsh critic of the wave theory. He much preferred Newton's idea that light was a stream of particles. And to show just how ridiculous the wave theory was, He showed that Fresnel's theory would predict a bright spot in the shadow, right in the middle of the shadow behind a circular object. That there would be a spot, almost as bright as if the object wasn't there at all. And he thought this was absurd. But my question is, Does it exist? Is the brightest part of a shadow really in the middle? To find out, we're gonna have to do the experiment. So first I had to find some circular obstacles. I selected spheres instead. I got some marbles and some small spherical magnets. Then for a powerful light source and a large distance to the screen, I selected a lecture theater with a projector. Now the first thing we're gonna need is a small aperture for the light to pass through. So I'm gonna poke a hole in this card with a screw. It's important to have a small aperture because you want the light to be in phase. And that should work if it's all coming out of this small little aperture. But when I put a sphere in front of it ... Alright, somebody hit the lights. Here we go... I can't see a bright spot. I can't really see anything. So next I tried a cellphone flashlight, putting a marble in front of that And again I could see nothing. I don't see anything in the middle. The idea with Poisson's spot is that light should diffract around a circular object, or a sphere, And because the center of the shadow is equidistant from all the edges of that obstacle, all of the light should constructively interfere at that point creating that bright spot. So next I tried an overhead projector. I tried a string of the small spherical magnets. It's weird. Like, I feel like I can see it. Derek: Do you think you can see a bright spot in the middle of that bottom one?       Girl: No. Derek: No? I feel like in the very center of each one, I can see a bright spot. I don't know. My eyes are just totally going nuts up here. Like, staring at shadows and trying to see what we want. But this one is opaque. It's nice and speherical. Set it down... And if I adjust the focus... You can see there's a bright spot right in the middle of that marble. So the spot looks pretty good, but something about it didn't sit right with me. And you know, when you think something is true, you really should try as hard as you can to disprove it. What if you used your fingers to kind of  make the edges less spherical? Yeah You see now that, that I think is concerning, that fact we can still see a bit of spot even though it looks like you're... Right? How is the light getting through and getting there? What was really happening, was light was coming up from from the base of this overhead projector, bouncing off this lens, back onto the top of the marble, and then back up through this lens, and onto the wall. So finally I decided to use a laser I resisted doing this earlier because in 1818 they didn't have lasers. In fact, Poisson didn't do the experiment. He didn't think that you needed to. The idea of a bright spot in the middle of a shadow was just so ridiculous. And Fresnel didn't do the experiment either. But one of the other judges by the name of Arago decided to actually do the experiment. And when he did it, he saw something similar to what I saw. So here I was using the laser through a diverging lens. And then that beam was shone onto a marble resting on top of a loop of tape. So you can see on the wall, basically exactly what you'd expect. Just a shadow of the marble But when you turn the lights off... there it is... A bright spot right in the middle of that shadow. So the brightest part of a shadow is, in the middle! As long as it's the shadow of a circular or spherical object. Now this spot is sometimes called Arago's spot because he did the experiment and found it. Sometime's it's called Fresnel's birght spot because it was his theory. But pretty frequently, it's referred to as Poisson's spot. A harsh reminder that it's not only your great achievements, but also your greatest mistakes that can be named after you. We don't see Poisson's spot in our day-to-day lives for many reasons, one of which is that most objects are not prefect circles. Plus if they have any surface roughness, really any at all, that will completely wash out Poisson's spot. And finally, most light sources are not coherent. That is, the waves are not coming all in phase: peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs. You might think you could never see Poisson's spot under ordinary conditions. But you can... What you need to do is look at a diffuse source of bright light like a fluorescent tube or the blue sky. You should see some small light specks drifting around your visual field. Now those are caused by floaters. Little particles actually drifting around inside your eyeball. And they can be all sorts of different shapes, but some of them are spheres. And so they cast a shadow on the back of your retina. And right in the middle of that shadow is Poisson's bright spot. And that is what demonstrated that light really is a wave phenomenon. And you don't even have to take my word for it. You can see it with your very own eyes."


"Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Steve Seitz and Chuck Dyer used view morphing to  digitally reveal a side of the Mona Lisa we've never seen before. What it would look like if she stared directly at us. That's her but it seems a bit unfamiliar. I mean, there is only one iconic view of the Mona Lisa. There's only one physical object you can look at to say that you saw the Mona Lisa with your own eyes. Photographs exist. There are copies you can also look at. There are forgeries, there are parodies but the true original Mona Lisa is in the Louvre. That's where it is. But where is this video? Seriously, where is this video? I mean, it's on your screen right now but it's also on a lot of other screens. Where's the original? Well, it's stored on YouTube servers and the original export is on my hard drive but those are just instructions for making the video. This video is anywhere. Every stream, every viewing of this video is, as Bill Thompson would say, ""a digital simulacrum of something that has no original"". So, how does a museum curator  or an archaeologist deal with this? Well, they are rethinking curating. I mean, take a look at this sculpture. ""The distance from this sentence to your eye is my sculpture."" That's pretty cool, but how do you put something like that in a museum? This sculpture and this video can be endlessly copied and every version is made out of different stuff at different times, a bit like your body. There's an identity crisis going on. As I discussed before, every few years nearly all of your atoms are replaced. Old ones leave, new ones come in. Where is the original you? Like this video, you are really just the result of a set of instructions being followed. And in our cases, interestingly,  those instructions are kind of forgeries. 'The $12 Million Stuffed Shark' is a great book about the art world. It mentions that, at one point in history, there were 600 Rembrandt's hanging in museums and 350 Rembrandt's in private collections. The only problem is Rembrandt scholars say that Rembrandt only ever made 320 paintings. Mistaken identity, forgeries and phonies have been around for a long time. In 1496 a young Michelangelo, the same Michelangelo that painted this, forged a statue. He treated the statue with acid to make it look not like his own work but like the work of ancient Greeks or Romans, so he could sell it for more money. But really, what's wrong with a forgery? I mean, sure, supporting forgeries is like supporting plagiarism but as far as intrinsic aesthetic properties go, what's the difference? Whether painted by Da Vinci, or a dog, or copied perfectly by a robot, wouldn't the Mona Lisa smile just as mysteriously and cooly? Well, here's the thing. We feel like the original, the Mona Lisa Da Vinci originally made, has an aura about it. As Richard Wiseman discussed in Quirkology - a great book - psychologist Paul Rosen once studied just how obsessed we are with relics, things important merely because of their auras. He found that people were more willing to wear a sweater that had been dropped in dog poop than they were to wear a sweater they had been told what was once owned by a mass murderer. We are influenced by auras. Right now, I am in Mougin. The city in southeastern France where Picasso died. On one occasion Picasso refused to sign a painting he knew he had painted, saying ""I can paint a fake Picasso just like anybody else."" You can disown your own paintings and you can disown your children but you can claim to have created your own paintings, but can you really claim to have created your own children? Let's explore a metaphor. Your mother is a 3D printer that printed you. But hold on, your parents conceived you and curated you, cared for you. But the actual blueprints that made you were outside of their conscious control. Your blueprint is a forgery. It has been copied, replicated, over and over again, ever since the very first group of molecules were arranged in a way that automatically replicated billions and billions of years ago. It's not a perfect forgery. Changes occur every time, making successive copies a little bit different. But 99.9 percent of your DNA isn't different from anyone else's. Now, you might say, but wait, Michael, we all look so different. Kind of. But that's also because your brain is particularly good at recognizing differences amongst things that you are familiar with. It's called the cross-race effect and it's the reason new twins you've never met before look totally the same, until you get used to them. It's the reason people from a culture you're not use to tend to be more difficult to distinguish. And the reason, say, a big group of black labs you've never met before all kind of look like the same black lab. We all have a common descendant, a common person our DNA has been replicated from over and over again, making us, in a funny way, a big bunch of forgeries. Go back 50 forgeries ago, 50 generations ago, and that's enough to connect every single human living on Earth. I've said this before, you are at least 50th cousins with everyone else living on the planet today. But we can go back further than that, as Guy Murchie famously did. You see, animal populations, and even molecule populations, experience replication variation and selective pressures, which means you are trillionth cousins with all life on Earth and, technically speaking, quadrillionth cousins with water and trees and rocks. It's a beautiful notion but it's anything but new. The word 'human' comes from a word for soil. And compare the Hebrew word for 'ground' with their name for the first man. You are quadrillionth cousins with dirt, with rocks, with trees, with plastic, with the very clothing you are wearing right now. So whether you're fighting with a stranger in a bar or stubbing your toe on a rock, it's all just a family squabble. And as always, thanks for watching. Oh, hey, you're still there.

"so one of the questions a lot of us have been asking since the launch of james webb telescope is how exactly is it going to handle the collisions with various micrometeorites especially because it's going to be staying in space without any ability to repair this telescope for several years and very likely up to several decades or at least one decade in other words the question is what happens when one of the micrometeorites strikes the mirrors or hits some other essential part of the telescope is the mission going to be over well obviously the answer to that question is no but there is a more specific answer to this that we're going to be talking about in this video because as you might have heard already it just happened a slightly larger than average micrometeorite officially hit one of the main mirrors on the telescope but what you might have not heard yet is that this is not the first time it happened since the launch this is actually the fifth time it happened and the first four collisions were not really that major and so in this video i wanted to talk a little bit more about the details behind what happened what all of this means and more importantly what we know about these micro collisions or micrometeorite collisions from the previous import missions such as hubble which as you can probably imagine received so many more collisions over the period of about 30 years and this is exactly where we're going to start the iconic hubble telescope the telescope that changed everything and you might already be aware that in the beginning when the hubble just started operating nasa performed several so-called hubble servicing missions in order to replace some of the parts on the telescope that were either aging or were outdated or maybe even broken and as they were doing so they actually ended up bringing some of the parts back to planet earth to be studied in more detail and even in the first few years of its existence when the space around the planet was not really that crowded yet hubble has already accumulated quite a lot of different impact craters from various collisions so for example in 1993 approximately three years after the original launch these solar panels here had to be replaced because of the unusual temperature fluctuation they were causing to the telescope and the fun fact is that the solar panels were the contribution from the european space agency and were actually then returned to the esa for further study once they were retrieved from the hubble telescope and this was actually the first opportunity in history of space exploration to see the kind of impacts that would occur on any spacecraft after about two years orbiting planet earth and here they found hundreds of impact craters on just a small section of the solar array some of them were extremely tiny only microns in size but some of them were relatively large approximately several millimeters then nine years later solar panels were replaced yet again returned to planet earth and once again even more impact craters were found here as well this particular solar panel is actually on the display in the netherlands inside the esa's technology center known as aztec but in this case the scientists also wanted to find out where exactly the impact craters came from was it from micrometeorites was it from some kind of a human-made debris or was it from something else entirely in other words they also decided to conduct a chemical analysis on every single one of these collisions and they did so by looking at whatever was unusual present inside the impact craters that should not have been there and that probably came from something else and so for a lot of these impact craters the fragments inside were from micrometeorites it was because of things like iron and nickel but some of them also contained aluminum and oxygen which very likely came from human activity essentially from various solid rocket motors or from various space debris and considering the amount of debris that's orbiting the planet it should not really come as a surprise and here the team even went as far as matching the shape and size of various craters to actual models of rockets that were responsible for producing the debris but obviously even after 30 years of the collisions here the hubble telescope is still operating and still producing all the imagery we have today in other words the scientists have definitively established that these collisions these micrometeorites even though they do cause occasional problems are not going to be causing any major faults in a telescope or are going to be the reason for the emission failure although they do cause a kind of a gradual degradation in the amount of power the solar panels can provide and also the gradual declination in the quality of images but in this case some of this can be actually restored with software although interestingly enough in the last decade or so the amount of debris has obviously increased dramatically and the chance for a collision has gone from approximately 0.15 chance per year to approximately 0.3 per day increasing by about 700 times okay but that's collisions on the hubble telescope what about james webb i mean we know that the solar panels should be okay over time but how about the other parts the shield or the telescope mirrors which in this case are directly exposed to open space well first of all we have to remember that because this particular telescope is not orbiting the planet but it's actually in the lagrange 2 point it's pretty far away from any human-made debris and because of this the chance of a collision here is pretty low overall on top of this in this region it's also not going to be receiving a lot of micrometeorites which usually tend to approach planet earth simply because it's the largest gravitational body in this area but more importantly these mirrors were specifically designed to withstand impacts from soundly smaller micrometeoroids although over time it's very likely that the appearance of these mirrors is going to become a little bit more rough reducing in the overall reflectivity and also becoming a little bit more rugged as well but for the first few years all these imperfections can be easily corrected digitally and also because when the mirrors were originally designed they were created to be even smoother than they should have been in other words the actual telescope does not have to be as perfect as it currently is it can still operate even if the mirrors are slightly scratched and so today the models suggest that it will probably take at least a few years before any of this becomes a significant problem and since the original launch a few months ago there have already been force more measurable micrometeoroid strikes with all of them directly meeting the expectations and the mathematical models however the most recent fifth collision was a little bit larger than the predictions and the original assumptions and so because of this the scientists behind the mission have to crunch a few numbers and develop future techniques for when this happens again at the moment though this is definitely not a problem and is not going to cause any issues for future observations and so in this case the mission is still a go and it's still going to be performing way beyond our expectations and the recent measurements just from a few days ago suggested that all the components on the telescope are still performing way beyond expectations and technically even exceed the original expectations the scientists had for this mission and since the telescope has already been in space for i guess half a year receiving only five collisions is actually good news it means that maybe this will be a lot less common than the scientists thought there's actually a really good article by nasa that you can find in the description below it sort of goes through very common questions about the resiliency of this telescope and how likely the mirrors are to survive a lot of different types of collisions from various micrometeorites with the scientists here even explaining different techniques that were used to test the mirrors and how everything on a telescope was engineered to withstand a lot of different types of damage and a lot of bombardment from various objects and one of the ways that all this will be done in the future when there's a lot of damage on the telescope is going to be by adjusting the position of certain segments and thus canceling out the portion of distortions coming from the damaged parts in other words there is a physical way in which the scientists are going to be able to try to counteract the damage to certain mirrors and this has already been done for the recently damaged segment known as c3 and when it comes to more dramatic events such as meteor showers the team in this case can also prevent the further damage by conducting certain protective maneuvers so for example by turning the optics away from known meteor showers before they occur although the most recent collision was not from a meteor shower it was one of those events that just happens by chance and one of the other things that the scientists are hoping to learn from all of this is actually in regards to these collisions by keeping the james webb telescope in this position for several years it sort of turns the telescope into a kind of a highly sensitive detector of various micrometeorites which can also help us learn a little bit more about the micrometeorite condition in these environments and also teach us a little bit more about the collisions as we become interplanetary species and as we start launching missions to for example mars and so it will definitely help the scientists measure the overall effect of micrometeorite collisions for various other objects and various other telescopes especially in the region known as the lagrange two points something that has never really been measured before by previous missions and so at least for now that's kind of all we know we know that the james webb seems to be operating normally we know that it's going to be releasing its first images on july 12th and we also know that the mission seems to be a go and nothing seems to be broken and will probably stay normal for many years to come in this case the entire telescope was definitely engineered and designed to withstand a lot of different damage but once more news comes out on once we'll learn something else i'll make sure to fold this up in another video until then thank you for watching subscribe maybe share this video with someone who loves learning about space and sciences and maybe come back tomorrow to learn something else

"about three years ago i made a lot of videos about this one phenomenon that back in 2019 gripped the world the phenomenon in regards to the star known as beetlejuice middle juice pirogeus say it three times and he appears behind you wait that's from another movie anyway you might already remember the story but back then the scientists were not sure what's actually happening to this iconic star one of the brightest stars in the night skies for some reason it started to dim with its overall brightness dropping by quite a large amount as a matter of fact the change was quite visible in a nice case if you knew where to look but then within a year by february of 2020 it stopped demon and started to brighten yet again and ever since then for approximately two years it more or less remained the same with some of the more recent observations using other frequencies such as infrared white determining that not much has actually changed around the star suggesting that it wasn't really going through some major changes on the inside and more importantly suggesting that it's definitely not going to go supernova as suggested by some of the media sources this was not going to happen for at least 10 000 years or possibly even longer and following several major observations in various frequencies and very thorough investigations by some of the best scientists around the planet it was more or less confirmed that what was happening to middle juice was very likely a result of a mid-remission from the surface that ended up creating a relatively large dust cloud with the dust cloud when released from the surface essentially blocking the star in just the right way which resulted in the overall demon effect and this is pretty much the explanation that everyone accepted it kind of made sense it also was supported by evidence from various telescopes and because beetlejuice has now been acting relatively normally there was absolutely no reason to suspect that it's going to go supernova or do anything else extremely unusual but there was still one question what exactly was this event what happened to beetlejuice three years ago to make this happen and i guess more importantly is it going to happen again can it happen again and that's exactly what the recent article from nasa tries to explore and it's actually by the relatively famous scientist who was actually the first to ever image the surface of this particular star using hubble telescope back in 1996. back then they were able to produce these beautiful images you see right here and were even able to resolve the first ever hot spots on the surface of another star other than our own sun and so the same scientists wanted to see what actually happened here and wanted to once again use hubble to investigate this and to try to resolve the mystery once and for all although in this case they didn't just use hubble they used several different observatories for example stellar robotic observatory in spain one of the telescopes in harvard and even one of the telescopes that's currently orbiting the sun known as stereo although in this case the data from the hubble telescope was actually the most beneficial and the one that was able to help us resolve this and well first of all and i guess that's the more important confirmation this star is not going to go supernova anytime soon the amount of mass lost from the star is completely insignificant compared to what we expect from a star that's about to go supernova but when compared to some of the more earthly terms the mass loss was actually pretty huge now in terms of the actual mass middle juice is at least 16 times the mass of our own sun it's also as you can see from this image not particularly spherical that's very common with these giant stars as a matter of fact there was a study not so long ago just a few months ago that sort of established that for these really really large stars it's generally relatively difficult to establish where their center is normally in astronomy to determine the center of the star the scientists will usually look for the center of brightness but for a typical red giant starlight beetlejuice the actual center of brightness the center of maximum luminosity tends to jump around or basically dance around and it actually kind of moves around everywhere it looks like this and so determining where the actual star is located and thus determining its distance becomes kind of problematic which basically suggests that these stars are just extremely active they're very unpredictable they're not particularly permanent in terms of shape and in terms of the actual activity on the surface and they're very dynamic they change all the time which is why here it does not look like a sphere and sort of resembles an unusual blob a blob that's not particularly dense either it's almost like some kind of a very large cloud of plasma rather than the actual star-like object but because this was such a bright star and a very well studied star and also a star with very predictable 400 day long pulsations that have been studied for nearly 300 years when suddenly the star experienced an unusual dimming effect and the pulsations also disappeared this definitely created one of the biggest mysteries in 2019 and is still technically the bigger mystery today as well beetlejuice by the way is somewhere right there is the orange that you see with this here showing us the iconic orion's belt and the orion nebula that you can see surrounding the belt and so the scientists behind this recent study really wanted to find out where did the pulsations go are they going to come back and what caused the unusual demon effect with all the observations in this case once again suggesting that the star lost a huge part of its visible surface resulting in the production what the scientists now call surface mass ejection or sme for short and obviously this is a type of behavior that's never been seen anywhere else before to some extent i guess it's comparable to the coronal mass ejections cmes around our own sun and that's of course when our sun does something like this throwing off a huge amount of mass from its surface but when comparing the numbers what happened around betelgeuse was about 400 billion times larger in terms of mass equivalent in mass to several times the mass of the moon and that's completely unimaginable by current standards that's something scientists believe that the stars could not actually do but looks like they can and when this chunk there was several masses of the moon in size left the surface of the star it very likely fractured a huge part of the photosphere of the star with the gas then cooling down to form a dust cloud that essentially blocked the light from the star as seen from planet earth with the dimming effects lasting for just a few months and this particular event the first such observed ever has also dramatically affected the star with beetlejuice still recovering from all of this even now for example various convection cells that are present inside the star which normally drive the pulsation and the circulation of material might have been disrupted by this event and are still sloshing around uncontrollably unable to produce regular pulsations that's of course why the regular pulsations are no longer visible and although the telescope observations suggest that the outer layers could already be back to normal the surface itself is still quite disturbed and is still bouncing around creating a lot of chaotic behavior and so it will probably take some time before the photosphere can reveal itself and before the star can return to be normal and i guess more importantly it also suggests that this is definitely not the same mechanism as the coronal message action it very likely has nothing to do with magnetic lines or magnetic fields and very likely was produced by something entirely different currently it's believed to be an entirely new phenomenon but the scientists now believe that it could have been caused by some kind of a convection plume several million miles or kilometers across that bubbled inside the star and produced this unusual expulsion of material or in other words it was some kind of a star bubble millions of kilometers in size but i guess more importantly this event shows us how these huge stars generally lose their mass and how they prepare themselves for the eventual supernova afterwards but how long the recovery stage is going to take before beetlejuice returns back to normal that's not the question we have the answer to but we might have an answer if the scientists are able to observe this in the infrared light by for example using jim's web telescope or by conducting additional observations in other frequencies as well because the dust here is only visible in the infrared light this might actually help the scientists see some of the previous eruptions if they ever happened and it might also help the scientists track where this gas is going and how this gas might evolve the nebula around it or maybe even determine how long video juice actually has before it explodes at the moment though because this is still an entirely new phenomenon and it's never been seen before around any other star out there all this is basically news to us still an exciting new observation and definitely a really important one because the evolution of these red stars is crucial to the evolution of the rest of the galaxy and since beetlejuice is such an iconic star anything that happens around it is also extremely intriguing and extremely important but i guess until we'll learn something else or until new discoveries that's pretty much all i wanted to mention we'll definitely talk more about beetlejuice and other red giants in some of the future videos for now though that's pretty much it check out all the relevant links in the

"well let's start the video right here on google earth i wanted to show you this very interesting guided tour that you can find here by typing cern a guided tour that essentially takes you to the largest particle collider on the planet the cern collider and here you can kind of explore what all this looks like from the perspective of an engineer or scientist working here or you can kind of zoom in exploring the city itself admiring the entire infrastructure that was created in order to make this particular project operational hello info person this is anton and today we're going to be answering a question that i often get asked on the channel and didn't really get to answer before the question being why is it that we haven't really been able to create any black holes here on planet earth could a particle collider produce a black hole and would such a black hole be dangerous in any way to our planet something that appeared as a major concern for the last couple of decades ever since cern became operational with this article by nasa being particularly intriguing because of the title the day the world didn't end and all this was because of several articles written in various magazines back in the days that suggested that maybe in theory these particle colliders could actually produce some kind of a black hole that could maybe absorb everything on the planet and destroy planet earth but could any of this happen could these black holes be produced in the collider and could they actually destroy anything well if you're about to click away from this video the answer to all these questions is no but let me explain to you in more detail so one of these concerns was actually because of how powerful cern has become it's currently able to collide different types of subatomic particles at ridiculously high velocities with extremely high energies and in the last few years as the scientists installed more and more upgrades on this particle accelerator they were able to beat previous records achieving higher and higher energies which in essence allows them to create a lot of other subatomic particles or exotic particles that could have been predicted by some studies or could have never been thought of before and that's of course how the confirmation of the higgs boson came to be as well the existence of a subatomic particle that was very hypothetical until it was discovered approximately a decade ago but every few years the higher and higher energies are achieved and new records are established which at least in theory could allow the scientists doing all this discover new unusual subatomic particles new phenomena or potentially even new physics something we've discussed in one of the previous videos from a few months ago that should be in the description but early on specifically in the first few years there was a bit of a concern in regards to what could be created by these collisions could the scientists accidentally create something we don't really want to create on planet earth for example could you somehow merge particles in order to create something extremely dense something resembling a black hole a black hole that starts small but eventually absorbs the entire planet and everything around it as well and that's why science communication as a field and as a profession is super important because very often people misunderstand certain concepts and very often associate certain words or certain principles with something that is not actually true in this case black holes many people today imagine a black hole as a kind of a vacuum cleaner with unlimited power something that is super super powerful and something that essentially sucks up all the matter around it and something that even though it could start small would eventually absorb everything around it and expand creating something even larger than before but that's not actually what we believe black holes to be and we don't actually think they do that at all for example in theory you could turn anything into a black hole you could take an apple or you can actually take yourself and condense yourself into very very dense mass that would then become a black hole but in order for an apple or in this case you to become a black hole it would actually have to be ridiculously small even smaller than any subatomic particle for example you can use this calculator that you can find in a description to try to calculate how big of a black hole you would become based on your mass in this case an average adult would actually be a black hole of 10 to the power of minus 17 nanometers and that's super super super small once again that's more than most subatomic particles on top of this we know that black holes generally evaporate and that's based on the hawking radiation principle something that was proposed by iconic stephen hawking a few decades ago and according to this calculator the lifetime of this black hole would be 1 times 10 to the power of minus 11 seconds a tiny tiny fraction of a second before this black hole completely disappears becoming just energy and a black hole that's so small and the black hole that only exists for such a short period of time would not have time to do anything to anything around it it would not be able to absorb any matter it would not be able to do anything to any of the atoms or particles around it and it would just disappear and nobody would know it even existed but that's a black hole that's mass of a person in this case the amount of material used in these studies is minuscule and so the size of this black hole decreases dramatically and so does the total lifetime of this black hole if ever such a black hole was created it would actually exist for less than the universe allows the minimum time frame we have is called planck time in this case it seems to be below that limit in other words in terms of the modern understanding of how we think the universe works it would not actually allow for this black hole to even exist or if it did exist it would probably break some laws of physics somewhere but also because black holes don't work like vacuum cleaners but actually work more like typical objects with typical mass in this case it's all about gravity so even an object that for example is your mass or let's just say just an average adult would not actually exert that much gravity on anything around it in order to absorb more mass or to add more mass to itself because the only way a black hole can increase in mass is if it actually starts adding more mass to itself through some sort of a collision but because of the tiny size of this particular black hole it would simply be incapable of touching anything or reaching anything its gravity is also very low so it's not going to be attracting anything either so even if a black hole was somehow created in some kind of a particle collider it would just be insignificant it would disappear without anyone ever knowing and that's actually why it's almost impossible to currently answer the question of whether these black holes have ever been made on planet earth even if they were created they disappeared before anyone noticed but also the question is could it be created well the answer to that is probably also no even though the collision energy between these particles is really high it's still relatively low as a matter of fact some of the natural particle accelerators such as various black holes various very powerful explosions somewhere out there in the universe produce particles with energy hundreds of millions of times higher than anything we can create here on planet earth and even natural particle accelerators in the magnetosphere of our planet created by the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar radiation creates something that's more powerful than we create in cern and so if black holes could be created anywhere they are more likely to be created around our planet not on it but even here we don't think it's happening at all and if it has ever been created on our planet or above our planet well there would be signs of this somewhere possibly signs of large explosions so large parts of matter missing or something as a matter of fact there was an article i discussed last year that briefly talked about the hypothetical scenario where costs could be colliding with our moon and there should be a way for us to detect them by using modern calculations of various craters so far nothing but still possible but if by some chance cern does create a black hole based on current calculations of the total mass used it would only be approximately 5 times 10 to the power of minus 20 grams once again creating a black code that's just impossible both in terms of the time data would exist and even in terms of the total size it's actually below the allowed total length it's lower than one plank length the small size the universe currently allows according to this calculator here is the smallest amount of material needed for black hole to actually exist in terms of the length and in this case is going to exist for a tiny tiny tiny fraction of the time it's equivalent to about 11 micrograms or the amount of material you sometimes find written on for example a vitamin pill bottle and that's way more material and way more total mass than the scientists actually use inside these particle accelerators because of the amount of energy required the total mass here is much much much much lower and as you can see from this calculation the total size of this black hole is also minuscule so there's absolutely no way it can ever affect anything around it now it might still be affected by gravity of planet earth but even as it travels through our planet it's unlikely to touch anything or unlikely to interact with any of the particles either but even if it did absorb some of the particles as it moved to the planet it would still only absorb several thousand different particles increasing its mass by just a tiny fraction in other words it would not turn into this super massive black hole that would destroy everything and if it keeps absorbing more and more mass as it travels through the planet it would actually take it a pretty long time before it becomes anything significant in order for this black hole to become large enough to finally affect anything around it you would probably need trillions and trillions of years of traveling through the planet and constantly absorbing mass but because of the hawking radiation it's most likely going to evaporate faster then it's going to have a chance to absorb something else and so in order to create a stable black hole that's going to exist long enough for it to start absorbing mass from the planet and to possibly even grow large and larger in size you would need to have an initial mass of at least several billion tons because without this mass is going to become unstable and then evaporate but if there is a black code that's several billion tons in mass in that case it can actually start absorbing mass around it and grow larger and larger something that the scientists think might exist out there something we refer to as primordial black hose and something the scientists have used to explain the hypothetical dark matter that might exist in the universe at the moment all this is still hypothetical and none of this is certainly known and since none of the particle accelerators on the planet can accelerate so much mass all at once creating anything similar to this and we don't actually have to worry about some kind of a black hole destroying planet earth at worst even if the black hole is created it's going to disappear before anyone can even notice but at best there's just not enough mass for the universe to even allow for this black hole to exist we can create other particles subatomic particles but we cannot create a black hole that's going to exist because either its total size or its total time of existence is beyond the plank length or the planck time the minimal length and the minimal time allowed by the universe itself and so that's why cern or other particle accelerators did not end the planet when they started operating but they did discover a lot of intriguing things and potentially even things violating modern physics at least modern understanding of physics and that's something i've discussed in one of the previous videos you can find on the channel or somewhere right there or also in the description below there's also this other video about the potential formation of neutron matter on the planet that you might want to take a look at as well it's somewhat different from what we've talked about today but it's related to the unusual exotic particles that the scientists are trying to create on the planet something that was also created in the particle accelerator but anyway on that note hopefully this answers your question so don't worry about black holes on planet earth probably not going to happen on that note thank you for watching subscribe maybe share this with someone who loves learning about space and sciences

"so here I was doing a little bit of research on planet 9 and trying to find out if there are possibly other solar systems that have a somewhat similar structure with a relatively large planet on the outskirts of the main solar system and to my surprise I've discovered an article about a planet that is ridiculously large and ridiculously far away from its um primary star and that particular solar system is apparently the biggest solar system in our galaxy welcome to what the maath and let's talk about this solar [Music] system and to my surprise I was also able to find uh that system in space engine which we'll be using near the end of the video where we're going to explore that particular uh system in more detail but let's actually do this in Universe Sandbox first we're going to go into the normal solar system here and I'm going to show you how big that solar system is now it has a funny name its name is Tass J 2126 8140 unfortunately though this system or its star or its um Planet are not in uh Universe Sandbox it hasn't been added to um their catalog yet because it ends at 21 uh 1 and doesn't have 212 so that's okay we're going to create a manual um version of this particular system using our own Sun so here is Sun here's Earth this is one astronomical unit and let me just show you how large this system would be and essentially what they've discovered is so there's a central star uh very similar to our sun and relatively far away from it I'm going to have to use edit here uh at a distance of on average about 4500 astronomical units which is close to 5,000 times more than um the distance from our sun to our planet Earth there is a very very large gas giant and look at how much I have to zoom out here first there we go just place it around 5,000 astronomical units uh there's another star here and this star uh sorry not star there's another planet here and this planet is called two Mass J 2126 8140 and this is kind of what it looks like in the game so it's sort of um a gas giant that's about to become a brown dwarf that may one day uh or would have one day become a star if he had more mass but it just didn't have enough mass and so it stayed as a very very hot gas giant and when it was originally found um it actually had a different name as a matter of fact the scientists thought that this was a brown dwarf it turns out that it's not um and uh when they've originally found it it was classified as a brown dwarf until they realized it was actually moving exactly in the same direction and in exactly the same way as its parent star and so they had to then rename this to um to basically give it a a planetary classification because they realized this was actually the the largest possible solar system that we've found so far and uh the radius right here is about 5,000 chmical units which is about 7% of one lightyear so it's it's pretty far uh not I guess not as far as as as a near star to us which is four light years four four and and point2 light years um but it it is pretty pretty far nevertheless and one orbit around this star would take this planet about um 1 million years so yeah I'm sorry I keep calling it star but it's not really a star it's actually it is a very large gas giant and and so the temperature of um of this particular planet is close to 2,000 de C it's about uh 10 to 15 times mass of Jupiter and if I were to place Jupiter next to it this is what it would look like so it's in terms of size it's not much bigger than Jupiter but it definitely is a lot more massive and um it definitely might even have a very large sort of um Moon system around it it um which is what we're going to be exploring in space engine uh near the end of the video and what's really interesting about this particular system is that now we actually realize that uh Stars can actually form in different ways not just in how we usually imagine them forming from one sort of a disc of spinning material where certain things become planets certain things become uh moons and then certain things become uh the star essentially but here the new proposition is that there was very likely have been sort of like a cloud of gas in this region and a cloud of gas in this region that sort of uh coales into a star with planets and a gas giant with its own Moon so they actually were almost like a binary system except this never became a star and they were relatively far away from each other so here what would happen um if a star if another star came into um sort of vicinity of the system um unfortunately this this planet would lose its orbit so I'm going to demonstrate this by just launching a random main sequence star through this area right here I just launch it somewhere I don't know just here and here we go so if if this actually passes by relatively close to them uh the orbit of two Mass J 2126 would actually be disturb enough for it to lose its um orbital path and there you go this you can see orbit already changing and then eventually just kind of Fly Away into the other door [Music] system and interestingly it actually got Disturbed at first and almost lost its orbit and then it reestablished it so I guess um there's still a chance that it it may have had some sort of a close encounter with other stars and didn't really Escape uh but what what's really important to understand here is that it may have been formed in a very um relatively empty environment so other stars couldn't disturb these two and that its orbit is relatively weak so if I were to do this again let's just do this for fun one more time we're going to launch another random main sequence star going somewhere here and it's going relatively fast I should probably slow down a little bit let's slow down to 500 kilm per second and here we go so it's passing it's going to pass relatively close to uh the planet here and it's very likely is going to disturb its orbit uh to the point where it might actually escape and so there you go um so yeah there's H quite a lot of really cool theories that might form as a result of uh this discovery uh mostly in in relation to how our solar systems are formed and look at that it's reestablished the orbit again it's been really stubborn which is pretty cool I guess anyway so um what I wanted to basically talk about is the idea of us really not knowing that much about um how some Stars may actually form we have a lot of um hypotheses we have a lot of speculations but um now that we've found this really interesting system that has a planet so so so so far away uh first of all it suggests that uh yes Planet 9 might be a reality because we don't really exactly know how some planets might might form um and the other thing is that uh so there's actually quite a lot of different ways for solar systems to form and let's actually go into space engine and explore this particular uh planet or I guess you could call it on almost brown dwarf because in space engine it has some really cool planets around it and so if you go to space engine and you start typing two mass and then basically uh what you I think you you have to type is 2126 uh you will find there's only one uh star that um meets this classification and it's this star right here go to it and that's essentially what uh that planet is that what I was talking about unfortunately since this is a little bit outdated here it's still classified as a brown DF which which is what it was up until 2016 and 2016 we've realized that this is actually not a brown dwarf this is just a very large gas giant uh the mass here is a little bit larger than it should be here it's 23 masses of Jupiter in reality it's about closer to about 10 to 15 um or something close to about 40% mass of sun so it's it's relatively large but uh nevertheless it's not really a brown dwarf it is an exoplanet uh or planet outside of solar system and this particular exoplanet in space engine has its own system of moons and some which are actually really awesome I've already explored this a little bit but we're going to go and um land on some of them just to check them out so this here is a cool Oceania or a cool ocean world that check it out it looks relatively scary actually because it's kind of red and uninviting but essentially imagine being on this world and landing on this Moon that has these really really sort of dark red skies at all times this is what it would look like in a sky if you were to kind of land here and this is essentially an ocean I think I think that's an ocean um but this planet is this moon is relatively cold it's- 24Â° C so any water here would be obviously Frozen and anything else um like for example methane or any other um material would not actually be liquid just yet so it might not actually have any any actual oceans on it even though it's called Oceania the second one here is a cool or coold desert which is also pretty funny name uh- 148Â° c a pretty cool um Northern or Southern Lights or Aurora brial whatever you want to call it there um and once again this is a pretty red World very beautiful red World kind of reminiscent of Mars in the sense and what I really like about some of these desert worlds is that if you actually come really close to them you'll get to see all of the awesome procedurally generated detail that this game is famous for so the closer you get the more detail you get look at that we get almost get to see the sand grains so here we are we've landed on this really cool desert World um and so a lot of these are actually pretty interesting to explore and I'm I really like how uh this particular uh planet or exoplanet actually is not actually technically exoplanet yet so it's considered to be a star but because of this it's it has these various planets generated around it now we don't actually have the companion star or the main star here um unfortunately this star is not in the catalog for this game um but hopefully the developer will add it at some point because this was a pretty big Discovery in early 2016 so I'm sure he's going to edit it for sure now there's a few more Frozen worlds here um they kind of look very similar to the one I just showed you and so most of them basically look like darker and colder marsus uh and this one actually has a pretty interesting pattern on it almost looks like a picture of a man um but what I wanted to see is if there is also gas giants because I haven't explored all of these and I think there is actually no uh not going to be any gas giants here yeah so this is actually a pretty interesting and pretty accurate representation of what um this particular ex planet might have orbiting around it so all of these would be moons and um there will be quite a lot of them would be quite large so imagine just like our Jupiter has at least four major moons that we call Galilean moons this one seems to have six of them and they're all very large they're relatively cold and they would be um possibly quite dark as well because the only light they would be getting is from um the uh um the exoplanet itself and it doesn't actually meit that much light uh here it's a little bit larger so it Maks a little bit more light but since it's not technically even a brown dwarf it only really emits um large amounts of um infrared light which would uh make these planets relatively warmer than they would be otherwise but it wouldn't give them a lot of visual light so they would still be quite dark not even as bright as you see them here all right so I think that's all I wanted to show you in this particular video and I hope you enjoyed it so we're going to land on this oania once again and check out actually fly through these um Northern Lights as well and check out its surface one more time and um if you enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe if you still haven't and don't forget to share this video with someone who you think may enjoy Space videos as well like it if you liked it and look at this beauty holy cow this is actually worthy of a screenshot um and uh if you actually want to check out more of the videos uh related to space engine or Universe sbox 2 do check them out in the link that you see on the screen or in the description below and what I just realized is actually if I wait a little bit longer on the surface of this planet you'll notice that there's actually new effect here specifically look at that there's clouds in the sky this is such a beautiful view so this is what this Oceania looks like this is something I didn't expect to see while making this video this is incredibly beautiful so there's a almost like a sunset I guess I guess it's Sunset not really sunrise and you get to see the ocean floor here and then we can even go underwater I think yeah we can go a little bit underwater so there is some sort of a liquid I just don't really know what it is um because here it says we have atmosphere of carbon dioxide sulfur oxide and nitrogen but I don't think it's either one of these but anyway so that's essentially what I wanted to show you in this beautiful ending of this video and once again if you'd like to support this channel even more there's always the patreon page where you can possibly support me a little bit more so that I can actually make this channel even better even more interesting and produce more high quality videos anyway thank you so much guys I really appreciate all of your support I'll see you in the next video game you later and as always bye-bye"
