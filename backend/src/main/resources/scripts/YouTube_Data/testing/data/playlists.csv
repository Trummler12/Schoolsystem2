This playlist explores how nuclear energy works, its potential to help us fight climate change, and the risks that come with it. Are the benefits worth the danger? We break down the pros and cons, from clean electricity to radioactive waste. Speaking of waste—could we just launch it into space? And how dangerous is nuclear energy, really? We look at the human cost of past nuclear accidents and the lessons they’ve taught us. But the atom’s destructive side looms large: the threat of nuclear war still hangs over the world. What would happen if the worst came to pass? We dive into the terrifying concept of nuclear winter and what it means for life on Earth.

AI is changing FAST so rather than doing a full Crash Course series of 12+ episodes, we’ve prepared a mini-series of just the basics. Crash Course will never tell you what to think and we’re not the type of organization that responds to breaking news in real time. Instead, we’re here to offer a zoomed-out foundation upon which to base your own opinions as you continue to learn from other outlets about the world that’s changing around us.

Crash Course: Futures of AI will cover:
-What even is AI? What’s the history of this thing and how quickly has it evolved to what exists today?
-How could AI transform society? Will AI cause the next Industrial Revolution, and what might that mean for workers and the environment?
-How powerful could AI become? How do we measure the progression of AI? What are the consequences we’re already seeing, and what might be the future consequences of unchecked AI development?
-How might powerful AI cause harm? We’ll touch on misinformation, surveillance, authoritarianism, and (unfortunately,) more. 
-How could AI be governed? What are the potential approaches for controlling AI both nationally and internationally?

Imagining a “World without networking” is truly a nightmare. In today’s contemporary world, innovations and research are being carried out to bring all things on the internet to ease up the lifestyle and living. Undeniably, networking is the core of the internet. Security is undoubtedly an inevitable entity of today’s sophisticated world. It can be observed that the power of networking technology also has a series of side effects, vulnerabilities, threats, attacks, intrusion, security breaches, and all that are unethical. Whenever a new security measure is introduced on the computer/internet, parallelly the attack to break the security also emerges equally powerfully. If security is compromised then banking, defense, e-commerce, email, and almost all the sectors that rely on the internet will witness an apocalypse. Therefore cryptographic techniques and securing the network remain immortal either at the improvised level or new level. 
The purpose of the lecture series is to provide learners with the fundamental concepts of cryptography, number theory, modern ciphers, public-key cryptography, hash functions, digital signatures, security practices, system security, email security, IP security, and web security.  This series mainly intends for UG students to learn about various cryptographic techniques and network security concepts and practices.

translation, analysis, and optimization process of a compiler. A Compiler
is computer software that transforms program source code that is written
in a high-level language into low-level machine code. It essentially
translates the code written in one programming language to another
language without changing the logic of the code. The Compiler also makes
the code output efficient and optimized for execution time and memory
space. The compiling process has basic translation mechanisms and error
detection, it can’t compile code if there is an error. The compiler
process runs through syntax, lexical, and semantic analysis in the front
end and generates optimized code in the back end.

I want to make practical tutorials, not 'Hello World!'. Teaching people to 'Hello World!' in Assembly won't speed up their algorithms. I hope to get to MMX, SSE2/3/4, AVX and any other SIMD extensions. I want to show that hand coding Assembly is not difficult, it makes more sense in many aspects than C++. The rules and restrictions placed on programmer's in high level languages all go out the window, in Assembly, we do what we like!

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, I hope you will find new and interesting information herein.

I hope also to inspire people and show that programming is not mundane. These computer languages are amongst mankind's greatest and most powerful inventions. I hope to instill this enthusiasm in others.",2012-07-17T05:45:18.875894Z,29,,1

Between Skepticism and Mysticism:  An Introduction to the Occult Philosophy of Cornelius Agrippa

The Three Books of Occult Philosophy (De Occulta Philosophia - DOP) is rightly lauded by both academics and practitioners as the cornerstone of all modern occultism.  Despite this, the DOP goes tremendously understudied, making it much more celebrated than understood.  By extension, the totality of Agrippa’s occult philosophy - represented by his other theological, philosophical and hermetic writings - suffers all the more from lack of modern editions and translations. Finally, understanding Agrippa’s thought overall is greatly complicated by his infamous turn toward radical skepticism and fideism, seemingly his mature philosophical and theological position.  This series of lectures aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive introduction to the occult philosophy of Cornelius Agrippa.",2025-10-16T12:15:41.651546Z,16,,1

So if you don't see chapter 1, that's because that chapter is boring, and you don't need to have read it to understand the important stuff that happens in the rest of the book. 

The overall rundown is this:
Chapter 2 - Summary of John Austin's theory of law
Chapter 3 - Attack on Austin's theory
Chapter 4 - More attack on Austin's theory
Chapter 5 - Hart's own theory of law
Chapter 6 - More of Hart's own theory of law

These are the only chapters about which I made lecture videos, because these are the chapters that, in my opinion matter the most. And also these are probably the chapters that will be most emphasized in a typical jurisprudence course.",2020-07-20T15:28:41.210216Z,5,,1

But words are just bits of ink on a page, or soundwaves emanating from our mouths, or the movement of our body parts in sign language. How can these things be *about* the world? How do names refer to people and objects? What about words or phrases—like “Yay!” and “Boo!”—that are meaningful, but do not seem to refer at all? And how is it possible that mere speech can change the way the world is, such as when an officiant pronounces two people married, or when congress declares war?
