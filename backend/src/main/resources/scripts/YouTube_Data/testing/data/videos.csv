When we look back on the history of science and scientific progress, we celebrate the pioneers who dared to make life-changing discoveries. The truth is that the first people to introduce a paradigm-shift almost always face persecution, and many are overshadowed by the less-controversial minds who follow them.

Such is the case of Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor who fought a lifelong battle against a disease he couldn’t see and that the medical establishment repeatedly told him wasn’t real. How does a scientist or doctor combat bacteria when they don’t even know it exists? The epidemics bacteria, viruses, and germs brought to innocent hospital patients wracked hospitals of the day, but the history of medicine is as much one of complacency and cosmic explanations as it is about breakthroughs.

Ignaz Semmelweis used incredible powers of logic and deductive reasoning to isolate a problem so complex that it stymied all the scientific minds of continental Europe, first by examining data within the clinics of his own hospital, and then identifying the source of infection. Through years of refining an antiseptic regimen that would end up saving an incalculable number of lives -- and paving the way for better-known scientific giants like Lister and Pasteur -- Semmelweis compiled one of the era’s great medical texts, one that would change healthcare worldwide.

And for that, he was ridiculed, criticized, fired, dismissed, institutionalized, and beaten to de*th. The shocking story of Ignaz Semmelweis is the real story of scientific progress.

The most pressing threat to civilization is us -- and paradoxically, we’re also the solution. When Paul Ehrlich published “The Population Bomb” in 1968, he ushered in an era of doomsday predictions that we’re still in. There are more than twice as many people in the world now than when his book came out, and Ehrlich insists that the population bomb just hasn’t gone off yet. 

But optimists like Julian Simon see something else happening. They acknowledge that man-made threats of destruction are not only challenges we can solve -- and that we’re in a better position every day to eliminate our problems -- but that we’re also better off for it. 

The philosophical differences between Ehrlich and Simon led to the most famous bet in the world, a bet over natural resources that was really a bet about the future of the human race. And as wrong as Paul Ehrlich has proven to be, we’re so hard-wired to think like him that it’s actually perfectly reasonable to conclude we’re perpetually facing disaster.

There’s more to the story of Trofim Lysenko and the Soviet Union’s most disastrous era of science than you probably realize. Everyone knows of “Lysenkoism” regarding the USSR’s failed theories of genetics, but Trofim Lysenko’s lifelong body work was driven by a perfect combination of history, revolution, political theory, power, and personalities.

Lysenko’s impact on Russian biology was a direct result of crafting science -- and scientists -- in service of Vladimir Lenin’s new Soviet man at a time when the international scientific community was making tremendous progress on genetics and biology. But to Lysenko and Josef Stalin, the real science was in the potential of plants and animals to behave like Soviet citizens.

That led Russia and its scientists down a path that derailed progress for decades. But what if Lysenko’s theories on the inheritance of acquired traits actually have merit? A resurgence of support for Lysenko has gone beyond the grim history of science to look at what we know about altering the expression of DNA and how a human’s experiences in life can even affect their grandchildren. The truth is that modern genetics has little to nothing to do with Lysenko, but the specter of his pseudoscience continues to haunt the disciplines of genetics and biology -- and science as a whole.

The life, death, and legacy of Russian geneticist Nikolai Vavilov isn’t just one of the most compelling science stories of the 20th century -- it’s a combination of scientific progress, human resilience, and a celebration of both the scientific and human spirits.

Vavilov’s tumultuous career in biology and genetics flowed from Vladimir Lenin’s support to Trofim Lysenko’s hostility to Joseph Stalin’s outright persecution. And while Vavilov himself succumbed to Stalin’s scapegoating and purges, his groundbreaking efforts to create a global seedbank for the betterment of mankind inspired his peers to endure suffering beyond comprehension in the service of science.

The staff of Vavilov’s plant institute endured the nearly 3-year Siege of Leningrad: no heat, no safety, and most importantly, no sustenance. But while the rest of the city struggled to survive in conditions of starvation, Vavilov’s peers and staff were actually surrounded by the one thing that would keep them alive: food.

Dozens of scientists met their deaths to protect Vavilov’s vision despite protecting tons of the exact material that would keep them alive.

They did it for Vavilov, they did it for humanity, and they did it for science.

As the 20th century approached, our understanding of the natural world and of the cosmos was increasing at a more rapid pace than any time in the history of science. We were building on our knowledge of asteroids, the discovery of Neptune, and understanding the transit of Venus, and science fiction like Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" was taking our imagination deep inside our own planet.

But one man rejected the long march of seemingly-irrefutable scientific progress. The cult leader Cyrus Teed was convinced that we weren't living amidst a complex solar system, and that we weren't on top of the Earth at all. Cyrus Teed thought that we were living inside the Earth.

Teed's Koreshan movement focused on the concept of a hollow earth, and he set out to prove scientifically that we were living on a concave surface inside of a giant hollow ball. From the religious awakenings of Upstate New York to Chicago to a swamp in Florida, Cyrus Teed gained converts who believed in his science and his religion. But did the rectilineator Teed built to conduct his painstaking measurements prove that we're really living inside, or did they just prove that Teed and his followers were insane?

But lurking behind the Oompa Loompas and the giant peaches is the life of a scientist, an inventor, and a medical pioneer so important that his work has saved thousands of lives worldwide -- and Dahl did his best to make sure you didn’t know it.

The bizarre life of Roald Dahl is a true story full of twists, turns, and tragedies. He survived his own traumatic brain injury in a World War II plane crash, and it might have done him a bit of good as a creator. But years later when his infant son was hit by a taxi, Roald harnessed his surprisingly deep medical and scientific knowledge to help create a cerebral valve that would benefit generations of children… all while keeping his own involvement quiet.

His most significant contribution to medicine may have come after that when his wife Patricia Neal suffered a series of strokes. Roald Dahl wasn’t a neurology expert, and he had no special expertise in brain injury or stroke recovery. What he did have was a creative mind, and the regimen he invented to rehabilitate Pat’s brain and body became the standard for our treatment of strokes.

Was Roald Dahl a fantastic artist, or was he a talented scientist? The answer is… yes. And that begs the question: is there even a difference?

Genie presented an incredible opportunity to study the limits of and potential for language acquisition at a time when Noam Chomsky's ""Syntactic Structures"" dominated linguistic debates. But was it even possible to help an abused girl and study her at the same time? That depends on who you ask -- but the result was limited scientific knowledge and a broken life.

Every day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.

To make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.

And cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.

This is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.

Now the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.
It literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.
So it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.

To prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.
These nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.
You can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.

The process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.
As simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.
The kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.
While the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide
The kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.
At this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.

Check out the series on new safety features: http://ve42.co/MB
This video is sponsored by Mercedes-Benz, who invited me to come to Stuttgart to see their latest cars, crash test facilities and experience the innovations they are working on.

Physics is something that is directly applicable to car safety. Cars go fast, but they also sometimes collide with obstacles, which brings them to a sudden stop, subjecting the car and occupants to very high accelerations, which can cause injury or death. So the major idea to improve car safety is to reduce these accelerations and there are a number of ways to do this:

Passive safety:

Seat belts: keep passengers in the vehicle, preventing them from continuing with constant velocity, flying through the windshield and suffering a worse deceleration when they make contact with the road.

Crumple zones: increase the distance over which deceleration occurs, thereby reducing peak magnitude of deceleration.

Air bags: increase the distance over which the head decelerates, again reducing peak magnitude of deceleration of the head.

Active Safety:
Anti-lock braking system: rather than 'locking' the wheels as can happen if you slam on the brakes with a traditional braking system leading to the tires skidding across the road, ABS attempts to control the amount of braking so that the tires always roll with static friction in contact with the road. This increases the backward frictional force that can be applied to the tires, again increasing the distance over which deceleration occurs, and it gives the driver an opportunity to steer to avoid the collision (hence why it's referred to as an active safety system).

Special thanks to Mercedes for having me visit facilities in Stuttgart. I had a lot of fun making these videos so please do check out the series on Mercedes Benz's channel: http://ve42.co/MB

Some things we know make mosquitoes more attracted to you:
Exercising, higher metabolism, higher body temperature, more body odor, being pregnant, type O blood, infrequent bathing, lactic acid, ammonia, acetone.

There are a number of folk remedies people believe protect them from mosquito bites like drinking alcohol, eating garlic, or taking vitamin B. These do not appear to provide any benefit in lab studies and in fact drinking alcohol is associated with increased mosquito activity because it causes blood vessels near the surface of the skin to dilate.

And apparently some of your attractiveness to mosquitos is simply genetic. This may be mediated through your immune system, which is what a lot of the genes identified were associated with.

New series! http://vrv.co/paradigms

I'm not sure how alarmed to be about artificial intelligence. Personally I think it's really hard to predict when we'll create a machine that essentially has consciousness. That's because we don't know what consciousness is, how it works, what's required to create it etc. So It might be technologically around the corner or a hundred years away.

A few years ago I made a documentary about uranium, radioactivity and radiation. I always thought of the characters in our story as the scientists and maybe the uranium nucleus itself. It was only through making the documentary that I realized the real hero of the story is the neutron. Without a neutral nuclear particle, it would be virtually impossible to release the energy from the nucleus. But with it, and the idea of a chain reaction, nuclear energy went from science fiction to reality. That is something I had not grasped as clearly before and it motivated me to make this video.

I hope I've articulated everything clearly in this video. If not, I'll clarify in comments. Thanks to everyone who appears in this video and thanks to everyone who watches this video!

Veritasium is of course a combination of the latin 'veritas' meaning truth, and the common element ending 'ium'. I guess this is my version of the 'draw my life' craze that rolled through YouTube many years ago. Except I wanted to tell my story with the actual moments, the photons, the stored magnetic states. There's something about that which is so important to me (because I think the alternative involves fooling yourself) which is why I'm so fascinated by film and video.

One of my inspirations for the name Veritasium came from the end of the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats, in which he writes:
 ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all
                Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.""

I learned a lot in making this video and the one on my second channel with Prof. Jon Arnou. I changed a lot of my preconceptions, specifically I thought:

1. That the Earth's magnetic field was a passive thing - it shouldn't need a continuous input of energy to maintain itself (that seemed reasonable to me because the magnetic field has been around for a long time and it seems mostly stable). But as it turns out, the Earth is a giant electromagnet, and so of course those currents dissipate their energy as they encounter resistance in the liquid metal through which they flow. So the energy to continuously create these currents comes from the kinetic energy of the liquid metal flows in the Earth's outer core.

2. If it's convection, I'm thinking hot things rising, cooler things falling. But apparently the main effect driving convection is the compositional differences at the boundary with the Earth's inner core. This is because of the differential freezing at the boundary. Things like iron freeze into the inner core, while elements like sulfur do not. Hence the pockets of lighter material which then rise outwards.

3. I didn't get why the fluid motion was necessary for the generation of the magnetic field. I mean if it's a conducting liquid, it can conduct currents whether it moves or not. But the key is that the liquid metal can 'trap' magnetic fields. I imagine this like how iron channels magnetic fields. Then once these fields are channeled, they can be pulled and stretched, making more magnetic field.

4. Fluids operate very differently in rotating frames of reference. This is something I didn't intuitively grasp. But, as fluids move from the inner core outwards, those particles are moving much more slowly in the direction of rotation than the matter that has been there for a long time, which means the convection currents get deflected and form helices.

In summary, ultraviolet light interacts differently with matter for a number of reasons:
1. Some pigments selectively absorb UV so they may appear white in the visible but dark in the UV. The pigments usually dissipate the UV energy as heat, though the breaking of bonds can also occur.
2. Fluorescent molecules absorb UV light and re-radiate that energy as visible light. This makes them look dark in the UV but glowing under black light.
3. Ultraviolet light scatters more than visible light because the wavelength is shorter and Raleigh scattering is proportional to the reciprocal of wavelength to the power of four.

Watch my new documentary, VITAMANIA: http://ve42.co/vita

I came across this story as I was making the film Vitamania. When you ask sellers of vitamins why you should take vitamin supplements even if you eat a healthy diet, they will say because our food doesn't contain all the nutrients it once did. This is supposedly due to soil depletion, cold storage, food ripening off the vine, and global transport of out-of-season foods. And to an extent this is true. Foods contain the greatest amount of nutrients if they are eaten soon after they are harvested. An unexpected source of nutrient decline is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It causes plants to grow faster and bulk up on carbs but at the expense of other nutrients, so in percentage terms the amount of nutrients are actually declining. For now this decline is modest so supplementing with vitamin pills is probably unnecessary for most people with a healthy diet but it may be a concern in future.

Ultraviolet light causes damage to DNA, leads to cancer and photoaging: age spots and wrinkles. I was curious about this because UV is technically non-ionizing. A photon of UV doesn't have enough energy to strip an electron off atoms or molecules. However it does have enough energy to trigger photo-chemical reactions. For example, it causes pyrimidine dimers - the unauthorized covalent bonding of adjacent thymine or cytosine bases in our DNA. If these spots are not properly repaired, they may lead to mutations and cancer. Photoaging is typically the result of degradation of collagen and elastin fibers - scaffolding that supports the skin. This leads to wrinkles and saggy-looking skin.

Check out Head & Shoulders research on getting rid of dandruff: https://ve42.co/HS

Animation by Pindex: https://ve42.co/pindex

When I started this project, I wasn't sure what caused dandruff and I also didn't think much science would go into making a shampoo like Head & Shoulders. So what I learned really surprised me:

There are hundreds of scientists working on this shampoo. They run crazy-sounding experiments like hanging hair near Tokyo highways to understand how real-world environments deposit dirt on hair. They use sophisticated scientific techniques like electron microscopes, nuclear magnetic resonance and gene sequencing to study dandruff on the molecular level.

In fact they sequenced the entire genome of Malassezia globosa in 2002, one year after the human genome project. Their findings are published in international refereed journals. What they have found is that the Malassezia fungi create free fatty acids as byproducts of their digestion, which for some people create irritation and lead to hyper-proliferation of skin cells, flaking, histamines, inflammatory cytokines, and blood proteins reaching the surface of the skin. These findings indicate the unhealthiness of dandruff scalp and suggest a possible remedy - controlling the metabolism of the Malassezia fungi. This is achieved using different active ingredients in different products and different parts of the world, including zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, and piroctone olamine. With the reduction of irritants, the scalp actually expresses different genes, producing a signature more similar to a non-dandruff baseline scalp.

Do you know how hard it is when you are thrust into low-gravity, like the 37% of Earth's gravity of Mars, and you have to remember what you were going to say in a 30 second window as blood floods your head? It's pretty hard. It would be even harder to actually travel to Mars. It would take about 8 months in microgravity during which time your muscles and bones would weaken substantially, even if you exercise for hours a day like the astronauts on the space station. And your heart is a muscle too so it weakens as well. Before I contemplated these rates of muscle and bone loss, I thought the major challenge with a round trip journey to Mars would be the logistics of spacecraft and having enough fuel to get back. But with the weakening of the human body, it's an open question whether anyone would really want to come back.

Human brains are complicated - the most complicated thing in the known universe, many people say. So far we understand little - just that certain regions of the brain appear to be involved in certain activities and certain disorders. In extreme cases this has led to the practice of removing sections of the brain, or using electrodes or optical fibers to control activation rates. What is unique about this approach is it offers a way to turn on and off specific brain regions without invasive surgery. It has promise because it combines existing technologies: micro-bubbles, ultrasound, synthetic viruses, and synthetic drugs to achieve this goal.

wCrtk-pyP0I,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,Veritasium,Microwaving Grapes Makes Plasma,"A bisected grape in the microwave makes plasma. But how does it work? A grape is the right size and refractive index to trap microwaves inside it. When you place two (or two halves) close together the fields interact with each other creating a maximum of electromagnetic energy where they touch. This creates heating, sparks, and plasma, which is further fed with energy directly by the microwaves.

Part of this video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2SmRQkk
Special thanks to Dr. Abe Davis for revisiting his research with me: http://abedavis.com

This video was based on research by Dr. Abe Davis and colleagues. I found out about this work years ago and was fascinated by the way he was able to capture vibration information in image-only video. I always imagined the motions of objects would be visible as when recording a tuning fork in slow motion - so deriving sound from high speed images seemed a feasible task. But the reality is much more difficult.

Sound vibrations only cause objects to wiggle by about a micrometer. This is much smaller than a pixel, so the algorithm must understand the characteristics of the image. A move in one direction should cause some pixels to lighten slightly, while others darken - and this behavior is correlated along the edges of the image. So noise can be reduced because it's random over the image and there are enough places to sample that you can get it to cancel out.

Something I'm wondering now is - would it be possible to capture sound in a single image? I'm thinking it would have to be an image of a large object or space because the wavelengths of typical sounds are quite long. Maybe a high frequency sound could be imaged in a suitable medium...

1. Part count (reduced by having flexible parts instead of springs, hinges)
2. Productions processes (many, new, different enabled by compliant designs)
3. Price (reduced by fewer parts and different production processes)
4. Precise Motion (no backlash, less wear, friction)
5. Performance (no outgassing, doesn't require lubricant)
6. Proportions (reduced through different production processes)
7. Portability (lightweight due to simpler, reduced part count designs)
8. Predictability (devices are reliable over a long period of time)

This is a video I've long wanted to make, about what makes video look like video and, up until 10 years ago or so, not as appealing as film. I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.

zUyH3XhpLTo,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,Veritasium,How to Understand What Black Holes Look Like,"We have just seen the first image of a black hole, the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87 with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our sun. But what is that image really showing us?

This is an awesome paper on the topic by J.P. Luminet:
Image of a spherical black hole with thin accretion disk
Astronomy and Astrophysics, vol. 75, no. 1-2, May 1979, p. 228-235
https://ve42.co/luminet

Using my every day intuition I wondered: will we see the ""shadow"" of the black hole even if we're looking edge on at the accretion disk? The answer is yes because the black hole warps space-time, so even if we wouldn't normally be able to see the back of the accretion disk, we can in this case because its light is bent up and over the black hole. Similarly we can see light from the bottom of the back of the accretion disk because it's bent under the bottom of the black hole. Plus there are additional images from light that does a half turn around the black hole leading to the inner rings.

What about the black hole ""shadow"" itself? Well initially I thought it can't be an image of the event horizon because it's so much bigger (2.6 times bigger). But if you trace back the rays, you find that for every point in the shadow, there is a corresponding ray that traces back to the event horizon. So in fact from our one observing location, we see all sides of the event horizon simultaneously! In fact infinitely many of these images, accounting for the virtually infinite number of times a photon can orbit the black hole before falling in. The edge of the shadow is due to the photon sphere - the radius at which light goes around in closed orbits. If a light ray coming in at an oblique angle just skims the photon sphere and then travels on to our telescopes, that is the closest 'impact parameter' possible, and it occurs at sqrt(27)/2*r_s

Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.

Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.

Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.

Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.

Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!

The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.

My sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them. But a little bit of motion causes them to move around and you sink through quickly.

Aerogel’s extraordinary properties are due in large part to its structure. Aerogel is a solid but on the nanoscale it has a mesh or sponge-like structure. The struts of this structure are nanoscale, as are the pores at around 20nm across. This makes silica aerogel incredibly light (it was once the lightest solid but has now been superseded by graphene aerogel), transparent and adsorbent. 

An ice-cube sized piece of aerogel has an internal surface area roughly equal to half a football field. Aerogel is used in high end museum cases to regulate humidity. Plus it helps maintain the vacuum on the Mars Insight seismometers - it adsorbs moisture and other outgassed volatiles that come from the spacecraft itself. Proposed uses include as a physical insecticide by ‘drying out insects’ reducing the need for chemical and toxic pesticides.

When making a video about vitamins I thought the story would mainly be about supplement pills, whether we should or shouldn't take them and how they're made. But what I found out is vitamins have a remarkable story that affects many more aspects of our lives. For example the Vikings needed a source of vitamin D to last the dark winter months and for their children to develop strong, healthy bones, avoiding rickets.

I found this story fascinating because in a way a nuclear bomb crater is more like a meteorite impact site than an impact site itself. Consider: Barringer Crater was claimed to be a meteorite impact site but geologists dismissed it as a volcanic formation. It was only after studying nuclear bomb craters and the minerals found there that geologists concluded the energy and pressures that created Barringer Crater were too high to be from volcanic activity and therefore must have formed from a meteorite impact.

Full disclosure: I drive an #electric #car. I think electric cars are the future, not mainly because they're better for the environment (which they are if you drive the car for any reasonable length of time) but because they are just better cars. The have better torque and acceleration, better handling, they're more efficient, quieter, they don't smell, they're cheaper to run and best of all you never have to visit a gas station - this appeals to me. I never have to worry about being low on gas because every morning my car is charged and ready to go - just like my phone and laptop. And if you're worried about range, don't. Almost all trips can already be done in an electric car with modest battery pack. And fast chargers along the way make it possible to do longer road trips if necessary. You have to make rest stops anyway, just time them with the charging. And consider that battery tech is getting dramatically cheaper, smaller, lighter. All these reasons are why I see the #future of cars as electric.

It has now landed and safely checked in with the rover. It should detach and fly within the first 30-60 days of the mission. I learned a lot getting to visit the drone right before it was mounted on the rover at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

How do you fly in 1% of Earth's atmosphere:
Have large rotors (they are 1.2m in diameter) and spin them very fast, around 2500 RPM (5x the speed of a helicopter on Earth).

Plus the aircraft has to be light:
The Mars helicopter weighs in at 1.8kg or around the same as a laptop. Every piece had to be stripped down for weight. Instead of using aerogel for insulation, the craft makes use of CO2 gaps between components. Even aerogel was too heavy!

One of the major challenges is surviving the Martian night:
Temperatures plunge to -80C to -100C so two thirds of the craft's power is actually used to keep its electronics warm. Only one third is used for flying. The estimated flight time is 90 seconds.

The craft can't be driven remotely, it will have to fly autonomously, using its own sensor suite to determine how to fly. The round trip 20 minute delay with Earth means steering the craft from mission control would be impossible.

For this video I partnered with Starbucks to celebrate their Nitro Cold Brew. Order one here: https://starbucks.app.link/derekmuller

Making liquid nitrogen is hard - in fact up until 150 years ago scientists doubted whether it was even possible to liquefy nitrogen. In 1823, At the royal institution in London, Michael Faraday first produced liquid chlorine, kind of accidentally by putting it under high pressure. He similarly liquefied ammonia.

Borrowing a mixture from Thilorier in France, a combination of dry ice, snow and ether, he reached a temperature of -110C. By 1845 he used this mixture plus a hand pump to pressurize gases to liquefy all the known gases except six, which included oxygen and nitrogen. These became known as the “permanent” gases.

A French Physicist Aimé compressed oxygen and nitrogen in tanks and then lowered them into the ocean over 1.6km deep, where the pressure got up to 200 atmospheres. Still the gases didn’t liquefy.

Only at the end of 1877 were the first droplets of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced, by Cailletet in France. He first tried oxygen by compressing it up to 300 atmospheres, cooled to -30C, but that wasn't even enough to liquefy oxygen. But when he suddenly released the pressure, the expanding gas cooled, he estimated to -200C and he saw a mist and then droplets slide down the walls of his vessel.

It's amazing how far we've come in that now I can purchase a helium-based cryocooler. It compresses and expands the gas to absorb heat from the tip of the cold finger and eject it into the surroundings at ambient temperature.",2019-08-16T17:06:32Z,27,veritasium|liquid nitrogen|nitrogen|how to|ln2|lini|make|cryocooler|nitrogen membrane|liquid air|cold|cryogenic,PT13M43S,true,en,en,8018342,109046,5787

I had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.

Below is a further discussion by Henry Reich that I think helps summarize why axes 1 and 3 are generally stable while axis 2 is not:

In general, you might imagine that because the object can rotate in a bunch of different directions, the components of energy and momentum could be free to change while keeping the total momentum constant.

However, in the case of axis 1, the kinetic energy is the highest possible for a given angular momentum, and in the case of axis 3, the kinetic energy is the lowest possible for a given angular momentum (which can be easily shown from conservation of energy and momentum equations, and is also fairly intuitive from the fact that kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared, while momentum is proportional to velocity - so in the case of axis 1, the smaller masses will have to be spinning faster for a given momentum, and will thus have more energy, and vice versa for axis 3 where all the masses are spinning: the energy will be lowest). In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.

Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",2019-09-19T15:50:15Z,27,veritasium|intermediate axis|tennis racket|theorem|flip|spinning|space|handle|rotating|rotation|axis|lastpass|lastpass login|password|password generator|lastpass chrome|lastpass download|lastpass premium|random password generator|generate password|password manager|recover|lastpas|laspass|lastpass premium features|delete account mobogram|lastpass.com|how secure is my password|last password,PT14M49S,true,en,en,13730790,344279,19826

On first glance it's surprising that origami -- a centuries old art of folding paper to achieve particular aesthetics -- is applicable to engineering. But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.

I have long wanted to make a video about chaos, ever since reading James Gleick's fantastic book, Chaos. I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.

QRt7LjqJ45k,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,Veritasium,How to Slow Aging (and even reverse it),"Scientists like Prof Sinclair have evidence of speeding up, slowing, and even reversing aging. 
Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLP

What causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. 

To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.

Reversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.

His book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'

Code for solving the Schrödinger equation by Jonny Hyman available here: https://github.com/jonnyhyman/QuantumWaves

I learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.

In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.

Pavol Dobryakov turbulent simulations: https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/

I got into turbulent flow via chaos. The transition to turbulence sometimes involves a period doubling. Turbulence itself is chaotic motion, it is unpredictable and sensitively dependent on initial conditions. What surprised me is all the ways turbulent flow is useful to us. It is diffusive, meaning it causes mixing. This is useful in jet engines or rocket nozzles (which Destin studies) and is important to achieve in microfluidic devices, which are so small that turbulent flow is actually difficult to achieve. Turbulent flow can energize a boundary layer, which is important to maintain flow attachment over a wing, maintaining lift and delaying stall. Similarly a turbulent boundary layer over a golf ball reduces pressure drag allowing golf balls to fly further. This is the reason for the dimples on golf balls. Flow transitioning to turbulence in the wake of a bluff body can create periodic vortex shedding. This beautiful phenomenon can be seen in the von Kàrmàn vortex street in clouds viewed from space. Turbulence is everywhere, in the air currents in a room, in your aorta, in the breaths you exhale, in oil pipelines and water pipes, in the flow over cars and ships and planes. Animals have evolved for it (like dead fish swimming up stream) and we have engineered our environment, our planes and golf balls for it. Laminar flow may be nice to look at (which is why we use it in decorative fountains) but turbulent flow does the real lifting.

Thanks to Google for sponsoring this video! Learn more about Search here: https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/

Special thanks to J.M.E.H van Bronswijk, author of 'House Dust Biology'. We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash:

- Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scales
This is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors.
The 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin).
You can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building.
However, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate.

- 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scales
It depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger.
For mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles.

- larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, synthetics
That's true .. including bread crumbs ..... 🙂

- skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed.
..... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming.
It has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours.

- skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc.
Yes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales.
However, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites.

On Thursday February 18th, 2021 the NASA Perseverance Rover will land on Mars. It is a wonderful robot, made out of steel and wire — but will future robots look like Perseverance? There is an emerging field of  research on ""soft robots"", where the machines are flexible. These soft robots have many advantages over traditional robots — they're safer, lighter, more flexible and can change their shape and size.

NASA is investigating the use of soft robots for space missions. For future visits to Enceladus or Europa, a lander could cut a hole in the ice and then insert a compliant robot through the hole. This robot could then grow and change shape on the other side.

Xzv84ZdtlE0,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,Veritasium,The Man Who Gave us the Power To Destroy Ourselves (Oppenheimer),"J. Robert Oppenheimer forever changed the course of history. He may be the most important physicist to have ever lived. Part of this video is sponsored by Wren. Offset your carbon footprint on Wren: ​https://www.wren.co/start/veritasium1 For the first 100 people who sign up, I will personally pay for the first month of your subscription!

If you want to learn more about Oppenheimer, I strongly recommend the book “American Prometheus” By Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin. It was the inspiration for Christopher Nolan's 2023 film ""Oppenheimer"", which won multiple awards, including Oscars in 2024 for Best Picture and Best Actor (Cillian Murphy).

The classic introductory magic square is of Order 3, meaning there are 9 total spots in a 3x3 grid, with each line adding to a Magic Constant of 15. But why stop there?

As long as you count 1 as prime (which it was considered in the past), you can construct a massive 15 x 15 (Order 15) magic square out of the first 225 odd consecutive prime numbers ranging from 1 to 1,427 with a Magic Constant of 9,635? YEP, HERE IT IS.

Sometimes it feels like too much of a coincidence, like being able to take the reciprocal of Pi and permute its digits into the reciprocal of the Golden Ratio. Not enough for you? Tack on another Pi digit and throw it in front of the reciprocal of Phi and you'll get the actual Golden Ratio's digits.

TqnYf2h6A-k,UCqmugCqELzhIMNYnsjScXXw,Vsauce2,The Dangerous Math Used To Predict Criminals,"The criminal justice system is overburdened and expensive. What if we could harness advances in social science and math to predict which criminals are most likely to re-offend? What if we had a better way to sentence criminals efficiently and appropriately, for both criminals and society as a whole?

That’s the idea behind risk assessment algorithms like COMPAS. And while the theory is excellent, we’ve hit a few stumbling blocks with accuracy and fairness. The data collection includes questions about an offender’s education, work history, family, friends, and attitudes toward society. We know that these elements correlate with anti-social behavior, so why can’t a complex algorithm using 137 different data points give us an accurate picture of who’s most dangerous?

The problem might be that it’s actually too complex -- which is why random groups of internet volunteers yield almost identical predictive results when given only a few simple pieces of information. Researchers have also concluded that a handful of basic questions are as predictive as the black box algorithm that made the Supreme Court shrug.

Is there a way to fine-tune these algorithms to be better than collective human judgment? Can math help to safeguard fairness in the sentencing process and improve outcomes in criminal justice? And if we did develop an accurate math-based model to predict recidivism, how ethical is it to blame current criminals for potential future crimes? 

Can human behavior become an equation?

A Magic Honeycomb? It can't have vertical paths to the constant because the spaces just don't connect that way... but there's an added element of difficulty in horizontal and diagonal paths being varying quantities of 3, 4, and 5.

But the real question is whether bees poop or vomit honey. And the answer is COMPLEX.

Numbers that use 6 and 9 are the most obvious examples, since flipping them upside down retains their full quantity and meaning… 69 is exactly the same right-side up or turned 180 degrees. And why does it matter? Why aren’t strobogrammatic numbers just a trivial curiosity?

There are questions about whether strobogrammatic properties reveal intrinsic value within numbers, but it also presents a pattern worth investigation -- including the subset of strobogrammatic primes. And when’s the next strobogrammatic YEAR? You probably didn’t live through the last one, and you’ve got about 4,000 years before the next one. GOOD LUCK.

When we take the subset of squared digits that result in a unique combination of those 10 digits? Now we're down to just 87 numbers n, all of which contain 5 digits.

You could find them all by hand, calculating every squared whole number until you got a value larger than 10 digits (and don't forget, all of them need to be unique), but over 50 years ago the IBM 1620 used its 1,200+ pound frame to work it all out. Do it by hand. What else do you have to do?

The digits 1, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9 can be progressively transposed to create a fluid circle of 6-digit prime numbers that works forward and backward.

You can start with any digit on this circle and move in either direction to generate a prime. The pattern is both simple and mathematically beautiful -- and THAT is why someone needs to make this into a necklace.

The object here is to come up with every possible way to divide a square grid into two perfectly symmetrical parts. Once you start by bisecting a 4x4 grid right down the middle, you’ve got to get creative -- especially as you advance to 5x5 and 6x6 grids. It’s a task that requires you to calculate, visualize, and apply rotations -- but with a bit of ingenuity and elbow grease, you can complete the entire table of possible solutions.

It’s true -- you can get the job done simply by transposing the first digit to the end of the number. 410,256 is a small, accessible number to try it. Just slide the 4 from the first digit to the last digit and you’re all set… and it works with some much larger numbers, too.

In terms of mathematical value, these quirky numbers probably don’t lay the foundation for a groundbreaking Fields Medal-worthy discovery. But this is what recreational mathematics is all about: pushing and pulling on numbers to recognize patterns and curiosities that facilitate your ability to handle heavier-duty work, sort of like how poetry plays with words to express thoughts that *could* be written much more simply. It’s beautiful. And it’s just plain interesting.

But the Schumanniophyton problematicum plant's leaves are determined by algebra, and a simple equation can tell you exactly how many leaves it has or how long it's lived. The Schumanniophyton problematicum's leaves can be expressed by 12Y + 4, where Y is the number of years the plant has been alive. 4 years? 52 leaves.

And it gets more impressive. Schumanniophyton problematicum is one of four plants to contain rohitukine naturally, which has shown antiinflammatory properties and can combat leukemia and colon cancer cells.

The idea is to develop a basic understanding of graph theory, which focuses on the relationships between things -- and you can express those relationships visually. Each match consists of three parts: a ‘node’ on either end, and the line that connects them. There’s only 1 solution for a graph of 1 match… it just lays there. 2 matches? Also just 1 solution, two matches that form an angle (putting them end to end to form one line with a shared node in the middle is technically a solution, too).

The goal here is to keep making unique arrangements with increasing numbers of matches. By the time you’re using 8 matches, you’ll have over 200 possible ways to combine them to form a unique pattern of nodes and lines.

It’s what tracks the spread of public health crises and undergirds every social media platform on the internet.

But one of the simplest problems in mathematics -- how to connect three utilities to three houses without crossing lines -- has proven to be impossible. Grab a sheet of paper and try it out. It won’t take long to realize you can get very close, but never solve the three utilities problem -- and you’ll see quickly that graph theory is a hidden force in everyday life.

The idea is to make a grid of squares starting with a 3x3 arrangement and move your ‘Knight’ through the grid without crossing its own path. Whether your goal is to touch as many squares as possible, make the most efficient path, or find the Knight’s maximum number of moves on a given grid, the moment you solve the puzzle, it’s time to make it harder. You can extend the grid to keep its dimensions equal or you can extend it vertically or horizontally -- anything works.

But by the time you’re solving the Knight’s Tour with a grid of 8 or 9 squares on one side, the patterns become insanely difficult. Computers can calculate Knight’s Tours easily even with grids 10 or 12 squares wide -- but can you?

bXitS_PMyFQ,UCqmugCqELzhIMNYnsjScXXw,Vsauce2,Why Mathematicians Won't Help Cops,"Algorithms are so amazing at predicting what you want that ads will be perfectly tailored to your interests and displayed to you just minutes after a complex system has basically mapped your mind. If that’s so easy, why can’t police predict crimes? A few companies claim they can -- but the truth is a lot more complex.

A decade ago, predictive policing algorithms were hailed as one of the most important inventions of our era. In just a few short years, thousands of mathematicians had publicly refused to work on predictive policing projects. What started a century ago in the concentric zone model of mapping urban areas and evolved into social disorganization theory has culminated in sophisticated algorithms that claim to pinpoint the place and type of crime well in advance. 

The problem, though, is that algorithmic outcomes are only as good as the data going into them. Between flawed data collection/reporting, yet another black box algorithm, and a total inability to measure results effectively, the promise of predictive policing has come under scrutiny -- and the real question is how long we keep experimenting to get it right, and who we run those experiments on.

DaA6x8xyvIY,UCqmugCqELzhIMNYnsjScXXw,Vsauce2,The Number That Gets You Shot,"Imagine a world in which everything about your life -- your friends, your family, which school you went to, your social media activity -- are reduced to a simple number used by police and the government to determine whether something bad will happen to you.

It sounds crazy, and almost paranoid, but algorithm-based initiatives have aided police from Chicago to London to help guide public safety interventions. In the case of Robert McDaniel, he was assigned a score that put him on Chicago’s “Heat List,” and he was told that he was likely to be involved in a shooting. But police didn’t know whether he’d be the shooter or the victim.

That resulted in the city offering him a range of services, but it also put him on the police’s radar -- and that began a chain of events that fulfilled a grim prophecy.

The promise of advanced math utilizing increasingly sophisticated data collection grows stronger by the year… but so do its potential perils. Can quantifying a person’s behavior actually tell us anything useful about them? And if it can, is it ethical?

The rise and fall of Chicago’s Heat List demonstrates not just how predictive policing works, but how it impacts individuals. And while the calculations themselves are a black box, there’s one thing we do know: once you’re on the list, you can’t get off.

TBaO8iOqOD8,UCqmugCqELzhIMNYnsjScXXw,Vsauce2,Math That Gets You Arrested,"One of the most significant developments in the history of policing is the use of statistics to track crime patterns and to determine how to react to them. New York City’s CompStat program has served as a model not just for cities around the United States, but also globally. And it makes sense, right? The better we track crimes and the more data we have, the more effectively we can allocate resources to improve public safety. 

Unfortunately, New York City (and everyone else) has found that it isn’t that simple. Jack Maple’s bold vision for a statistics-based police department has been plagued by inconsistent application and perverse incentives that prioritize numbers over public safety. The perpetual conflict between good policing and good CompStat numbers has mitigated the program’s positive effects and magnified its criticism on civil rights grounds. 

CompStat reinforces our biggest problem with statistics in public life: the numbers we increasingly depend on don’t lie, but we don’t always know which truth they’re telling us.

We’ve been collecting and analyzing social statistics for about 200 years now. In some ways, we’ve made a lot of progress -- but in others, we’re just as clueless now as when André-Michel Guerry first set forth his laws of tracking crime. Mixing math and morality introduces so many possible variables that our interpretations of the data can range from insightful to harmful. Comparisons of violent crime between Scotland, India, and Estonia show just how difficult it is to make sense of social statistics, especially if we try to judge them in relative terms.

A handful of additional problems plague our analysis: data and its inferences that are good today might not hold up in the future, and a study of Boston-area youth shows how surprising long-term outcomes can be. Perverse financial incentives, underreporting, and catching minor criminals instead of the major drivers of crime all make our understanding of antisocial behavior that much more tenuous. Throw in the media’s use of our social statistics and it feels like the more we know about crime, the less we understand.

bjHcD3JPrnY,UCqmugCqELzhIMNYnsjScXXw,Vsauce2,The Problem With Talking To People,"If you can’t trust yourself, then who can you trust? Well… everyone and no one. The paradox of self-reporting in all manners of data collection, from basic census information to detailed stats about crime, makes it difficult for us to understand the problems we need to solve. Is it best to design experiments and carefully cull datasets to observe the information we need? Should we rely solely on testimony directly from people involved, and then trust that their answers are correct? Is the right answer a blend of the two?

The truth is that they all have serious problems that lead us down the wrong path for making sense of social behavior. But if they’re all awful, how can it possibly be useful to employ every strategy together?

To understand crime, we need to measure crime. To measure crime, we need to understand people. And all of it relies on a deep knowledge of individuals who employ malevolence, who are victims of flawed and biased systems, or who are just plain wrong in good faith.

In a way, it’s hopeless -- but in the morass of human social behavior, we manage to progress.

From career mafia rats to kindergarten tattle-tales, no one likes a snitch. Every society reviles the informant -- but why? And how can game theory analysis reveal what’s actually happening when society rewards a snitch?

Despite teeming with serious problems, snitch culture is so deeply-engrained in law enforcement that it’s sentenced countless innocent people over centuries -- including convicting men of murder when no one was even killed at all. Why does snitching go so wrong so often?

The truth is that everyone involved in the snitch system is playing their own game. Police are the game masters and the house never truly loses. Informants are engaged in a form of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, while outside actors resort to tactics like witness intimidation to win their own game within a game. 

The result is a perversion of justice so severe that everyone ends up worse off -- including the famously impartial blind bastion of justice.

Nothing is more exciting than a high speed car chase -- and it turns out that almost nothing is more dangerous, too. Suspects, innocent pedestrians, and even the police themselves are subject to everything that makes watching movies like Fast & Furious or playing Grand Theft Auto a seriously entertaining experience. For thousands of people every year, that means serious injury and even death.

But the crazy thing is that we know exactly how to solve the problem, and no one seems to care.

I analyzed the data and even found an anonymous source inside a state police department who was willing to tell me how car chases really work. The result? We’re doing something that’s bad for everyone, usually for unimportant reasons, with life-changing consequences.

And why do we keep doing it? The benefits are minor and the consequences are major. But if all the data suggests the tradeoffs we make when we engage in car chases isn’t worth it, why don’t we just stop? That’s the problem here… and no one cares.

How does herd mentality go wrong and lead to the madness of crowds? How can we harness it for the wisdom of crowds? Vsauce2 explores the fine line between group smart and group crazy.

The age of mass communication has brought with it mass psychogenic illness alongside opportunities to crowdsource solutions that improve the world. It's a delicate science we're trying to navigate.  Are we smart enough to make use of our herd mentality or we will succumb to the madness of the crowd?

When we think of the human experience, we tend to focus on the good things: love, happiness, and progress. But what if the most important part of our lives is actually one of the worst? Our relationship with pain stretches back further than any other sensation, and it turns out that pain has been and continues to be our most important teacher. We paradoxically need something awful to survive. Vsauce2 explores the science and psychology of pain going all the way back to our four-legged ancestors. 

Despite pain dictating daily life for millions of years, we’ve only come to understand exactly how it works fairly recently. We now know the exact physiological mechanisms of how pain works within our bodies -- which evolved from rudimentary scientific theories from Descartes and others -- but we’re still figuring out how it works within our minds. And as we navigate the science of it all, from neuroscience to psychology, we uncover more questions than ever. Should we eliminate pain, or should we learn to live with it? What happens to our identities when we take all the pain away, and is it worth the cost to ourselves? What is society’s responsibility to relieve pain, and how does politics factor in? How much of your pain is real and how much pain is essentially imagined?

On the surface it seems like an ideal world would be one completely devoid of pain, with strong mental health in conjunction with physical wellness. But the reality is more complex, and it’s worth thinking about the implications of the convoluted link between pain and suffering that we can’t live with… and can’t live without.

Could one of the staples of a gamer’s diet actually improve physiological health the same way it has for mice and worms? Is it possible to harness plant photosynthesis with a synthetic leaf that mirrors the same chemical process to replace fossil fuels? Will small armies of robot cartographers replace Google Street View cars -- and eventually explore the unknowns of Earth’s oceans? How long have hominins existed in Greece, and are our Mediterranean ancestors hundreds of thousands of years older than we think?

The James Webb Space Telescope has just captured images of molecules over 12 billion light years away -- but are they just specks of matter, or are they the building blocks of stars?
Han Solo’s nap in carbonite might just be a part of your own future now that mice have been induced into a state of torpor -- and it has implications for improving emergency medicine. The idea of inducing torpor was first proposed to reduce the physical demands of space travel, and when you finally cruise to Mars, who knows how many arms and legs you’ll have? Researchers at MIT have tacked on a pair of supernumerary limbs that gets us one step closer to being space octopuses.
The future of science and technology gets more exciting by the day, but we continue to uncover amazing elements of our past -- like a 3,000 year old sword in Bavaria that has been preserved so well that its blade still shines. Past. Present. Future. Mind Blow!

This science research doesn’t just pass the sniff test -- it IS the sniff test. Our olfactory abilities are so refined that our noses can identify a person’s gender with over 96% accuracy from the smell of their… hands?!

Robotics is advancing past clumsy limbs and brute force by getting better at both -- this rolling robot that can make deliveries, throw objects, and dynamically adjust its application of force.

Sometimes our most advanced scientific discoveries already exist in nature -- like a tiny pill modeled after the pangolin that can roll up to be deployed in internal medicine applications. Oh, and it’s moved around your body by a magnet.

A scientific breakthrough has been sitting at the bottom of a canyon for decades -- and despite it being over 100 meters high, we’re only just seeing Asia’s tallest tree.

Birds are once again dominating the science news cycle, and this time it’s by thumbing their beaks at our efforts to deter them from public spaces. It seems like anti-bird spikes actually make great bird castles.

Until recently, bionic limbs have been rudimentary with little fine motor control -- but harnessing AI algorithms, neuroscience, and osseointegration may allow for natural motions in bionic hands and fingers.

The dark side of the Moon continues to keep secrets, like why there’s a giant slab of thorium and uranium resulting from a billion-year old moon volcano.

A giant 300,000 year old flint axe has been discovered in England, and it either hurt people, hunted animals, or just looked awesome.

You almost certainly know a psychopath in real life… and you may very well be one yourself. And that might even be a good thing.

We’ve recognized psychopathy in science and culture for thousands of years, yet we still don’t know what to do about it. Yet we use the word itself now more than ever, so much that the meaning of the word “psychopath” has become diluted in popular culture. As we increasingly learn more about the science of psychopathy, we should get better at deploying the term more accurately -- but instead, it’s become a catch-all for unconscionable human behavior and a mainstay of true crime stories.

Psychopaths are much more complex than that… for better and worse.

In reality, a psychopath’s brain creates and perpetually reinforces a moral code that is defined more by what it lacks than what it contains. From a total absence of anxiety to a simple utilitarian worldview that can do tremendous harm to others, the psychopath is a mix of brute force and the most subtle manipulation. And this is where it gets really complicated: you actually want the ruthlessness of a psychopath to run your company, you want the charm of a psychopath for investigative journalism, and you want the fearlessness of a psychopath to respond to medical emergencies.

Can we harness the biological and psychological forces that create dangerous, destructive psychopaths to improve humanity? And if we could cure or eliminate psychopathy… would we even want to?

You discover a new species of succulent. It’s composed of two tiny butt cheeks. What do you call it? BABY BUM. And there’s really no possible alternative, because this is Mind Blow.
An array of 100 robotic muscles that can flex 50 times per second is like a giant fluid trampoline with haptic response that can move and sort objects and also generate images. It’s like a waterbed mixed with a computer. What more could you need?

We talk a lot about AI in art, but we’re making fantastic progress in using AI to fuel neural bypass connections -- like an electronic brain-body-spinal cord bridge that has brought back movement and sensation in the limbs of a man with quadriplegia.

A full decade ago, Mind Blow highlighted the weirdly anti-bacterial wings of the clanger cicada. By analyzing the nanostructure of the wings, we finally know how the nanopillars on the wings kill bacteria and clean the surface -- and it has tremendous implications for sanitizing the surfaces of medical devices.

A 600-pound asteroid is coming directly for your head… sort of. It’s 13 million miles away, which means it’s classified as a “potentially hazardous asteroid,” and it’s tracked twice a day with a 3,200 megapixel camera. They say you never hear the one that gets you.

Spiders are incredible at pulling moisture from the air, and they do it by constructing webs on which droplets collect easily and efficiently. Replicating their process allows water collection to happen without expending energy. Science smarter, not harder.

What if tattoos could be functional instead of purely aesthetic? Nanotech’s got it covered, starting with individual cells. 3-D bioprinting technology can place a flexible tattoo that functions as a data collection and warning system for the body.

40 years ago we discovered fantastic fossils of the immortal jellyfish… and no one bothered to look at them until now, because sometimes science news takes a couple generations to develop. But the Canadian fossils are so detailed that some even reveal an animal’s last meal. They show that jellyfish as we know them today are even older than we thought -- but they’re still an aquatic whippersnapper compared to the sea sponge.
