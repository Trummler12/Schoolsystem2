# Task Docs: [AKSEP] Tag strategy research (1/1)

## Mode & Score
Mode: plan-gate, Score: 4 (factors: touches >2 files, adds new file, no tests cover doc changes)

## Changes
- Schoolsystem2/tags/TASK_PLAN.md: plan-gate skeleton + discovery/planning updates (SHA pending)
- Schoolsystem2/tags/Tag_Strategy.md: rewrote strategy doc, added constraints, options, and sources (SHA pending)

## Checks & Results
- Manual verification: not run (documentation updates only)

## Follow-ups / Risks
- Prompt override / deviations: user confirmed existing baseline files under `Schoolsystem2/tags/` may remain during planning, so pre-approval git status is not clean.
- Follow-up: policy change requested to allow baseline files during plan-gate (pending user OK UPDATE POLICY).
